"Development of an intelligent tutoring system using bayesian networks and fuzzy logic for a higher student academic performance","Eryilmaz, Meltem and Adabashi, Afaf","Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","2020","Scopus","","10","In this experimental study, an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy Bayesian intelligent tutoring system (FB-ITS), is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the Bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. The effectiveness of the FB-ITS was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), fuzzy ITS and Bayesian ITS, separately. Moreover, it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. In order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used based on the students' pre-test and post-test scores. The study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. Results showed that students who studied using FB-ITS had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. Regarding the time taken to perform the post-test, the results indicated that students who used the FB-ITS needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. From the results, it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success. © 2020 by the authors.","Article","10.3390/APP10196638","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092448079&doi=10.3390%2fAPP10196638&partnerID=40&md5=1da779e1d6611f0443471d303867c947","","","","","","","Cited by: 28; All Open Access, Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.478703704","Accepted"

The Mobile Fact and Concept Training System (MoFaCTS) is an adaptive instructional system for simple content that has been developed into an interaction layer to mediate textbook instruction and so is being transformed into the Mobile Fact and Concept Textbook System (MoFaCTS). In this project, MoFaCTS is being completely retooled to accept texts from a textbook and to automatically create cloze sentence practice content to help the student learn the material in the text. Additional features in the prototype stage include automatically generated refutational feedback for incorrect cloze responses and a dialog system, which will trigger a short conversation by a tutor to correct conceptual misunderstandings. MoFaCTS administers this content via a web browser, providing the teacher with score reports and class management tools. Because the “optimal practice” module is interchangeable and the cloze content can come from any text, the system is highly configurable for different grade levels, populations, and academic subjects. To foster faster research progress, data export supports the DataShop transaction format, which allows quick analysis of data using the DataShop tools. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

"Impact of inquiry interventions on students in e-learning and classroom environments using affective computing framework","Ashwin, T.S. and Guddeti, Ram Mohana Reddy","User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction","2020","Scopus","759 – 801","30","Effective teaching strategies improve the students’ learning rate within academic learning time. Inquiry-based instruction is one of the effective teaching strategies used in the classrooms. But these teaching strategies are not adapted in other learning environments like intelligent tutoring systems, including auto tutors. In this paper, we propose an automatic inquiry-based instruction teaching strategy, i.e., inquiry intervention using students’ affective states. The proposed model contains two modules: the first module consists of the proposed framework for predicting the unobtrusive multi-modal students’ affective states (teacher-centric attentive and in-attentive states) using the facial expressions, hand gestures and body postures. The second module consists of the proposed automated inquiry-based instruction teaching strategy to compare the learning outcomes with and without inquiry intervention using affective state transitions for both an individual and a group of students. The proposed system is tested on four different learning environments, namely: e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom and webinar environments. Unobtrusive recognition of students’ affective states is performed using deep learning architectures. After student-independent tenfold cross-validation, we obtained the students’ affective state classification accuracy of 77% and object localization accuracy of 81% using students’ faces, hand gestures and body postures. The overall experimental results demonstrate that there is a positive correlation with r= 0.74 between students’ affective states and their performance. Proposed inquiry intervention improved the students’ performance as there is a decrease of 65%, 43%, 43%, and 53% in overall in-attentive affective state instances using the inquiry interventions in e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom and webinar environments, respectively. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","10.1007/s11257-019-09254-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077538149&doi=10.1007%2fs11257-019-09254-3&partnerID=40&md5=5e581dd6d58d2aed5a84e38bfe1bf120","","","","","","","Cited by: 33","45630.959386574","45631.611064815","Duplicated"

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is the task of modeling students' academic abilities. Given a sequence of student's learning history, it predicts how well they will perform in the next interaction. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the underlying structure of the student's understanding. In this paper, we point out the accuracy rate problem that the model won't reproduce the accuracy ratio. This is a limitation of the existing loss function in DKT that it only learns the probability of correctly answering a problem in the next interaction. We introduced the Knowledge State Vector loss, which captures the accuracy rate of all knowledge concepts, to measure and train the model.<br/> © ICCE 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising tool for developing instructional policies, as RL models can learn complex relationships between course activities, learner actions, and educational outcomes. This paper demonstrates the first RL model to schedule educational activities in real time for a large online course through active learning. Our model learns to assign a sequence of course activities while maximizing learning gains and minimizing the number of items assigned. Using a controlled experiment with over 1,000 learners, we investigate how this scheduling policy affects learning gains, dropout rates, and qualitative learner feedback. We show that our model produces better learning gains using fewer educational activities than a linear assignment condition, and produces similar learning gains to a self-directed condition using fewer educational activities and with lower dropout rates.","","10.1145/3313831.3376518","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3313831.3376518","","","adaptive learning, online education, reinforcement learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45631.555208333","Rejected"

The results show the dominance of a large-margin classifier at small training data sets above random decision forests and a feed-forward artificial neural network. However, we observe a sensitivity of the large-margin classifier towards the discriminatory power of used features which provides a guide for a selection of machine learning algorithms for the optimization of adaptive learning environments.

Such courses pose additional organisational challenges and require appropriate tools. The presented solution is based on an Intelligent Tutoring System immersed in repository of e-learning content, which enables selection of content immediately before its provision to the student instead of at the beginning of a course. Thanks to this, the system, having identified the student's needs, is able to make available the most suitable repository content at a given stage of education. The flexibility of the system is guaranteed by modularisation of content and its logical division using the UCTS taxonomy. The content has been described by means of concepts arranged according to the specificity of the domain to which the resources belong in order to ensure that the ITS is able to select relevant content. The proposed solution was used to set up an Applications of Fuzzy Logic course, which was part of an Artificial Intelligence class.

"Affective database for e-learning and classroom environments using Indian students’ faces, hand gestures and body postures","Ashwin, T.S. and Guddeti, Ram Mohana Reddy","Future Generation Computer Systems","2020","Scopus","334 – 348","108","Automatic recognition of the students’ affective states is a challenging task. These affective states are recognized using their facial expressions, hand gestures, and body postures. An intelligent tutoring system and smart classroom environment can be made more personalized using students’ affective state analysis, and it is performed using machine or deep learning techniques. Effective recognition of affective states is mainly dependent on the quality of the database used. But, there exist very few standard databases for the students’ affective state recognition and its analysis that works for both e-learning and classroom environments. In this paper, we propose a new affective database for both the e-learning and classroom environments using the students’ facial expressions, hand gestures, and body postures. The database consists of both posed (acted) and spontaneous (natural) expressions with single and multi-person in a single image frame with more than 4000 manually annotated image frames with object localization. The classification was done manually using the gold standard study for both Ekman's basic emotions and learning-centered emotions, including neutral. The annotators reliably agree when discriminating against the recognized affective states with Cohen's κ = 0.48. The created database is more robust as it considers various image variants such as occlusion, background clutter, pose, illumination, cultural & regional background, intra-class variations, cropped images, multipoint view, and deformations. Further, we analyzed the classification accuracy of our database using a few state-of-the-art machine and deep learning techniques.

Procrastination is one of the compelling characteristics that students observe as a failure to achieve the weaker outcomes. Past studies have mainly assessed the behaviors of procrastination by describing explanatory work. Throughout this research, we concentrate on predictive measures to identify and forecast procrastinator students by using ensemble machine learning models (i.e., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Forest). Our results indicate that the Gradient Boosting autotuned is a predictive champion model of high precision compared to the other default and hyper-parameterized tuned models in the pipeline. The accuracy we enumerated for the VALIDATION partition dataset is 91.77 percent, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. Additionally, our model allows teachers to monitor each procrastinator student who interacts with the web-based e-learning platform and take corrective action on the next day of the class.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the underlying structure of the student's understanding.

So he spends a lot of time identifying his need, selecting the most convenient data sources and finding the appropriate resources to the current content of his activity. However, in the era of Big Data, apart from the services offered by RS and other data filtering tools, data sources are currently experiencing a significant evolution in terms of volume and variety of available resources. Given the importance of these data, the quality of the recommended content is decreasing significantly, which implies poor knowledge and a failed learning experience. To enhance the quality of student’s learning, we propose an approach of recommending quality educational resources, in accordance to the learner’s learning progress and his individual needs.

This study explores how an automatic assessment is capable of tracking learners’ cognitive and emotional states during virtual reality (VR)-based representational-flexibility training. This VR-based training program aims to promote the flexibility of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in interpreting, selecting and creating multimodal representations during STEM-related design problem solving. For the automatic assessment, we used both natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning techniques to develop a multi-label classification model. We then trained the model with the data from a total of audio- and video-recorded 66 training sessions of four adolescents with ASD.

"A multidimensional deep learner model of urgent instructor intervention need in MOOC forum posts","Alrajhi, Laila and Alharbi, Khulood and Cristea, Alexandra I.","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","2020","Engineering Village","226 - 236","12149 LNCS","In recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have become one of the most exciting innovations in e-learning environments. Thousands of learners around the world enroll on these online platforms to satisfy their learning needs (mostly) free of charge. However, despite the advantages MOOCs offer learners, dropout rates are high. Struggling learners often describe their feelings of confusion and need for help via forum posts. However, the often-huge numbers of posts on forums make it unlikely that instructors can respond to all learners and many of these urgent posts are overlooked or discarded. To overcome this, mining raw data for learners’ posts may provide a helpful way of classifying posts where learners require urgent intervention from instructors, to help learners and reduce the current high dropout rates. In this paper we propose, a method based on correlations of different dimensions of learners’ posts to determine the need for urgent intervention. Our initial statistical analysis found some interesting significant correlations between posts expressing sentiment, confusion, opinion, questions, and answers and the need for urgent intervention. Thus, we have developed a multidimensional deep learner model combining these features with natural language processing (NLP). To illustrate our method, we used a benchmark dataset of 29598 posts, from three different academic subject areas. The findings highlight that the combined, multi-dimensional features model is more effective than the text-only (NLP) analysis, showing that future models need to be optimised based on all these dimensions, when classifying urgent posts.<br/> © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49663-0_27","","","Natural language processing systems;Learning systems;Deep learning;E-learning;","","03029743","English","Benchmark datasets;E-learning environment;Features modeling;Free of charge;Massive open online course;Multi dimensional;NAtural language processing;Online platforms;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Therefore, recognizing and understanding these states in the context of learning is key in designing informed interventions and addressing the needs of the individual student to provide personalized education. In this paper, we explore the automatic detection of learner’s nonverbal behaviors involving hand-over-face gestures, head and eye movements and emotions via facial expressions during learning. The proposed computer vision-based behavior monitoring method uses a low-cost webcam and can easily be integrated with modern tutoring technologies. We investigate these behaviors in-depth over time in a classroom session of 40 minutes involving reading and problem-solving exercises. The exercises in the sessions are divided into three categories: an easy, medium and difficult topic within the context of undergraduate computer science. We found that there is a significant increase in head and eye movements as time progresses, as well as with the increase of difficulty level. We demonstrated that there is a considerable occurrence of hand-over-face gestures (on average 21.35%) during the 40 minutes session and is unexplored in the education domain. We propose a novel deep learning approach for automatic detection of hand-over-face gestures in images with a classification accuracy of 86.87%. There is a prominent increase in hand-over-face gestures when the difficulty level of the given exercise increases. The hand-over-face gestures occur more frequently during problem-solving (easy 23.79%, medium 19.84% and difficult 30.46%) exercises in comparison to reading (easy 16.20%, medium 20.06% and difficult 20.18%).<br/> © 2020, The Author(s).","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-020-00195-2","","","Eye movements;Education computing;Learning systems;Computer aided instruction;Deep learning;Hypermedia systems;","","15604292","English","Automatic Detection;Behavior monitoring;Classification accuracy;Facial Expressions;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning approach;Nonverbal behavior;Three categories;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"
"Impact of inquiry interventions on students in e-learning and classroom environments using affective computing framework","Ashwin, T.S. and Guddeti, Ram Mohana Reddy","User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction","2020","Engineering Village","759 - 801","30","Effective teaching strategies improve the students’ learning rate within academic learning time. Inquiry-based instruction is one of the effective teaching strategies used in the classrooms. But these teaching strategies are not adapted in other learning environments like intelligent tutoring systems, including auto tutors. In this paper, we propose an automatic inquiry-based instruction teaching strategy, i.e., inquiry intervention using students’ affective states. The proposed model contains two modules: the first module consists of the proposed framework for predicting the unobtrusive multi-modal students’ affective states (teacher-centric attentive and in-attentive states) using the facial expressions, hand gestures and body postures. The second module consists of the proposed automated inquiry-based instruction teaching strategy to compare the learning outcomes with and without inquiry intervention using affective state transitions for both an individual and a group of students. The proposed system is tested on four different learning environments, namely: e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom and webinar environments. Unobtrusive recognition of students’ affective states is performed using deep learning architectures. After student-independent tenfold cross-validation, we obtained the students’ affective state classification accuracy of 77% and object localization accuracy of 81% using students’ faces, hand gestures and body postures. The overall experimental results demonstrate that there is a positive correlation with r= 0.74 between students’ affective states and their performance. Proposed inquiry intervention improved the students’ performance as there is a decrease of 65%, 43%, 43%, and 53% in overall in-attentive affective state instances using the inquiry interventions in e-learning, flipped classroom, classroom and webinar environments, respectively.<br/> © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-019-09254-3","","","Face recognition;Computer aided instruction;Convolutional neural networks;Deep learning;E-learning;Emotion Recognition;","","09241868","English","Affective Computing;Affective state;Automatic intervention;Facial emotions;Inquiry-based instruction;Student engagement;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

The need for qualified people has grown exponentially, which means that the resources for education/training are significantly more limited, so it’s necessary to create systems that can solved this problem. The implementation of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) can be one solution. Besides, ITS aims to enable users to acquire knowledge and develop skills in a specific field. To achieve this goal, the ITS should learn how to react to the actions and needs of the users, and this should be achieved in a non-intrusive and transparent way. In order to provide personalized and adapted system, it is necessary to know the preferences and habits of users. Thus, the ability to learn patterns of behaviour becomes an essential aspect for the successful implementation of an ITS. In this article, we present the student model of an ITS, in order to monitor the user’s biometric behaviour and their learning style during e-learning activities. In addition, a machine learning categorization model is presented that oversees student activity during the session. Additionally, this article highlights the main biometric behavioural variations for each activity, making these attributes enable the development of machine learning classifiers to predict users’ learning preferences. These results can be instrumental in improving ITS systems in e-learning environments and predict user behaviour based on their interaction with computers or other devices.<br/> © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23887-2_7","","","Computer aided instruction;Education computing;Machine learning;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;E-learning;Behavioral research;Biometrics;","","21945357","English","Adapted systems;E-learning environment;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning preferences;Learning Style;Non-intrusive;Student Modeling;User behaviour;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

In the UK, higher education is accessed by a large percentage of high school graduates (50% in 2017). Still, in Brazil, a limited number of pupils leaving high schools continue their education (up to 20%). Initial pioneering efforts of universities and companies to support pupils from underprivileged backgrounds, to be able to succeed in being accepted by universities include personalised learning solutions. However, initial findings show that typical distance learning problems occur with the pupil population: isolation, demotivation, and lack of engagement. Thus, researchers and companies proposed gamification. However, gamification design is traditionally exclusively based on theory-driven approaches and usually ignore the data itself. This paper takes a different approach, presenting a large-scale study that analysed, statistically and via machine learning (deep and shallow), the first batch of students trained with a Brazilian gamified intelligent learning software (called CamaleOn), to establish, via a grassroots method based on learning analytics, how gamification elements impact on student engagement.

Among these impediments, the cost and timelines associated with development and sustainment are prominent. To address these impediments, various researchers have worked to develop authoring tools for conventional and adaptive instructional systems. These tools speed the development and maintenance of these systems, reduce the associated costs, and allow less skilled developers to create high-quality courseware.

In this paper we describe such an approach for identifying students at risk of failure in online courses. For the proof of our concept we used the data of two cohorts of an online course implemented in Moodle LMS. Using the data of the first cohort we developed a prediction model by experimenting with certain base classifiers available in Weka. To improve the observed performance of the experimented base classifiers, we enhanced further our model with the Majority Voting ensemble classifier. The final model was used at the next cohort of students in order to identify those at risk of failure before the final exam.

"Examining Interventions and Cognitive Load Factors in Online Learning Experiences","Kwak, Seok-Joo","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global","2020","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Since the beginning of the development of massive open online courses (MOOCs), these and other online learning environments have been considered as potential partial solutions to some persistent problems in higher education. These learning environments, while they have great educational value, have not been as effective as they could be, because they have largely been built with little or no foundation in the cognitive processes (e.g., the conversion of items from short-term to long-term memory) required for effective and efficient online learning. Many innovative online learning approaches are in development, such as personalized learning (learning experiences tailored to address particular information that students need) using adaptive learning systems (machine learning techniques used by computers to recommend materials). However, these approaches would also benefit from being grounded in cognitive theory to better reveal how learning occurs in these systems. Furthermore, crucial features of interventions in online learning, such as supplementary elements designed to fill in gaps or reinforce knowledge, have not been thoroughly examined in conjunction with the insights of cognitive theory and the concept of desirable difficulty (i.e., the notion that the addition of difficulty to a task can improve learning and increase retention).In this exploratory work, I experimentally examine five different types of interventions and their effects on undergraduate engineering students’ learning gains and experience. This study presents quantitative research along with detailed qualitative thematic analysis. Its objective is to provide critical insights into how to better design online learning environments and how we can create more effective interventions that promote students’ online learning gains. The research questions for this work are: (1) What factors in online learning environments affect learning gains (i.e., measured difference between post- and pre-test scores) for undergraduate engineering students?; (2) What factors in online learning environments affect the learning experience for undergraduate engineering students, and, specifically, what factors produce desirable difficulty?; and (3) What factors in online learning affect undergraduate engineering students’ self-reported memory?The experimental results, examined within the framework of cognitive theory, showed quantitatively that levels of frustration with interventions were correlated with learning gains while qualitative analysis results revealed instances that both confirmed and contradicted aspects of the quantitative results. A number of practical design guidelines emerged from the analysis: for example, in specific circumstances, one type of intervention is likely to be more effective than another, or that particular sorts of additional difficulties should be avoided. These recommendations may provide researchers with a better understanding of how to challenge students in more efficient and productive ways in online learning environments.

Towards this direction, this paper presents a MGBL application for the tutoring of computer programming. In this application, the system recommends to each student four peers to play with as competitors using genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm finds the most adequate peers for each student by taking into consideration students’ learning modality, previous knowledge, current knowledge and misconceptions. As such, the student can select from the list one person from the proposed ones, who share common characteristics. The two main reasons why homogeneous groups are chosen to be formed are to promote fair competition and to provide adaptive game content based on players’ characteristics for improving their learning outcomes.

"Developing a Neural Network Based Adaptive Task Selection System for anUndergraduate Level Organic Chemistry Course","Koseler Emre, Refika","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global","2020","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In the last decade, the immense growth of computational power, enhanced data storage capabilities, and the increasing popularity of online learning systems has led to adaptive learning systems becoming more widely available. Parallel to infrastructure enhancements, more researchers have started to study the adaptive task selection systems, concluding that suggesting tasks appropriate to students' needs may increase students' learning gains. This work built an adaptive task selection system for undergraduate organic chemistry students using a deep learning algorithm. The proposed model is based on a recursive neural network (RNN) architecture built with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells that recommends organic chemistry practice questions to students depending on their previous question selections. For this study, educational data were collected from the Organic Chemistry Practice Environment (OPE) that is used in the Organic Chemistry course at Arizona State University. The OPE has more than three thousand questions. Each question is linked to one or more knowledge components (KCs) to enable recommendations that precisely address the knowledge that students need. Subject matter experts made the connection between questions and related KCs.A linear model derived from students' exam results was used to identify skilled students. The neural network based recommendation system was trained using those skilled students' problem solving attempt sequences so that the trained system recommends questions that will likely improve learning gains the most.

The work presented in this paper lies at the cross-section between the areas of education, biodiversity and technologies. More specifically, this project builds on research in virtual agents in educational settings to promote young children’s engagement with a biodiversity curriculum. In this context, we conducted an observational study with 105 primary school’s children with the goal of evaluating the effectiveness of a virtual robotic agent (presented through a multimedia application), in providing an effective and engaging learning experience about local biodiversity to children. Our results suggested that a) older children (8 to 10 years) knowledge about certain animals and plants from their local biodiversity is well matured; b) younger children (6 to 7 years) present more faithful conceptualisations about nature-related scenarios compared to older children and c) both young and older children exhibited a preference for nature-related scenarios when compared to human-made ones. Our findings provide useful information in favour of the usefulness of implementing user-adaptive learning systems, by considering factors like the children’s previous level of knowledge. Besides, this personalised and interactive type of system might provide an essential advantage in learning scenarios, compared to ""static"" systems, in enhancing children’s learning outcomes.<br/> © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-62056-1_17","","","E-learning;Learning systems;Climate change;","","03029743","English","Biodiversity loss;Educational settings;Learning experiences;Learning outcome;Learning scenarios;Multimedia applications;Observational study;Virtual robotics;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

In recent years, there is growing interest in applying data-driven techniques for adaptive decision making that can dynamically tailor students' learning experiences. Most existing data-driven approaches, however, treat these pedagogical decisions equally, or independently, disregarding the long-term impact that tutor decisions may have across these two levels of granularity. In this paper, we propose and apply an offline Gaussian Processes based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework to induce a hierarchical pedagogical policy that makes decisions at both problem and step levels. An empirical classroom study shows that the HRL policy is significantly more effective than a Deep Q-Network (DQN) induced policy and a random yet reasonable baseline policy.<br/></div> © 2020 Inst.

However, the dropout rate of this modality is over 50\%, and only 22\% of students complete the courses [27]. Despite technological advances and good acceptance of this modality, research indicates that the lack of involvement in a virtual community can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, isolation and desmotivation. There is evidence that these feelings are among the main factors responsible for the low performance and high evasion rate. Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) handles a large volume of student interaction data. In this context, it is important to create mechanisms to maintain and manage a data structure to facilitate the processes of transforming data into information and knowledge. This paper aims to present a tracing agent responsible for maintaining and managing the data structure in VLE. The agent acts in the context of a microservice-oriented multi-agent system, interacting and collaborating with other agents in order to improve interaction and decision-making processes. This work becomes original and at the same time innovative, presenting an unprecedented combination of technologies and techniques in the context of VLEs.","","10.1145/3411564.3411630","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3411564.3411630","","","Virtual Learning Environment, Tracing Agent, Multiagent System","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"
"Human behavior as the source of data in the education system","Almazova, Nadezhda and Bylieva, Daria and Lobatyuk, Victoria and Rubtsova, Anna","","2020","ACM Digital Library","","","Information technologies are fundamentally changing modern society. Almost any human activity becomes the source of data for possible analysis and processing. The authors have analyzed more than hundred examples of data mining in modern society presented in open sources focusing on the field of education. In this study, the interdisciplinary approach is used. It makes possible to consider human activity as the basis for data analysis as the complex social phenomenon from the perspective of the sociology of communication and global Internet usage. At the same time, the authors note that the current development of technologies allows analyzing behavior of people not only in the Internet (online), but also in everyday life (offline) with the help of individual devices (cameras in smartphones and computers, fitness trackers, etc.) and with the use of facial recognition for various social situations. This study focuses on learning process and human behavior usage as the source of data in this area because information and communication technologies have changed the format of modern education. Therefore a significant part of education content has moved to the online environment. Integration of various data concerning e-learning, human movement, Biological Feedback can establish complex digital education model with prognostic and recommendatory functions that take into account behavior, individual characteristics, knowledge and skills in dynamics. This model supports a lifelong trajectory of personal development not limited by initial and final indicators and framework of educational institution. Nowadays technologies that allow tracking human behavior are causing discussions related to ethics and the issue of human freedom, though they provide deeper analysis of people's activities. Certainly these opportunities can be the benefit for society and miscellaneous social environment.","","10.1145/3372177.3373340","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3372177.3373340","","","Learning analytics, Education, Data, Behavior","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"

It is expected that there will be demand for more virtual activities in all aspects of life. Currently, most academic institutions are changing the way they offer their degree programs. New challenges and opportunities for robust online educational environments need to be critically examined. Many educators are now striving to learn how to teach online. National University started offering online programs more than twelve years ago. The authors of this paper have engaged in online teaching activities since then. In the early stages, many educators were reluctant to adopt this new method of education and they raised questions about the quality of online education. This article addresses this issue with evidence and compares it with the assessment data obtained by the university at the end of database classes taught between 2011-2016. The outcomes of this research indicate that the students at NU who took the database classes during 2011 to 2016 preferred online classes and learned either equally or better in online database classes than the onsite database classes. Suggestions are made about future research that may contribute towards generalizing these trends in other areas of computer science education with opportunities to serve the rapidly increasing online student population.","","","","","","","Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges","1937-4771","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"

Frequent gaming tends to cause bad learning outcomes. Though existing studies tackle the problem by redesigning the system workflow to change students' behaviors automatically, gaming students discover new ways to game. We instead propose a novel way, reflective nudge, to reflectively influence students' attitudes by conveying reasons not to game via information visualizations. Particularly, we identify three common gaming contexts and involve students and instructors in co-designing three context-specific persuasive visualizations. We deploy our information visualizations in a real online learning platform. Through embedded surveys and in-person interviews, we find some evidence that the designs can promote students' reflection on gaming, and suggestive data that two of them can reduce gaming compared with control groups. Furthermore, we present insights into reflective nudge designs and practical issues concerning deployment.","","10.1145/3386527.3405924","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3386527.3405924","","","reflective nudge, reflection, online learning, information visualization, gaming the system","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"
"Learning to represent healthcare providers knowledge of neonatal emergency care: findings from a smartphone-based learning intervention targeting clinicians from LMICs","Tuti, Timothy and Paton, Chris and Winters, Niall","","2020","ACM Digital Library","320–329","","Modelling healthcare providers' knowledge while they are gaining new concepts is an important step towards supporting self-regulated personalised learning at scale. This is especially important if we are to address health workforce skills development and enhance the subsequent quality of care patients receive in the Global South, where a huge skills gap exists. Rich data about healthcare providers' learning can be captured by their responses to close-ended problems within conjunctive solution space -such as clinical training scenarios for emergency care delivery- on smartphone-based learning interventions which are being proposed as a solution for reducing the healthcare skills gap in this context. Together with sequential data detailing a learner's progress while they are solving a learning task, this provides useful insights into their learning behaviour. Predicting learning or forgetting curves from representations of healthcare providers knowledge is a difficult task, but recent promising machine learning advances have produced techniques capable of learning knowledge representations and overcoming this challenge. In this study, we train a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for predicting learners' future performance and forgetting curves by feeding it sequence embeddings of learning task attempts from healthcare providers from Global South. From this training, the model captures nuanced representations of a healthcare provider's clinical knowledge and their patterns of learning behaviours, predicting their future performance with high accuracy. More significantly, by differentiating reduced performance based on spaced learning, the model can help provide timely warning that helps support healthcare providers to reinforce their self-regulated learning while providing a basis for personalised instructional support to aid improved clinical outcomes from their professional practices.","","10.1145/3375462.3375479","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3375462.3375479","","","smartphones, neonatal care, global health, forgetting curves, emergency care, deep knowledge tracing, clinical training","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"

In online education, it is often not possible to directly use these theories to control learner's classical conditioning, learning by doing, learning by imitation and social-cognitive skills concerning the course structure due to differences in learner's learning ecosystem. This research is the answer to this problem. In this research, we will propose a reference architecture for a lecture, based on theories given by Benjamin Bloom and Norman L. Webb.

Res.","2020","ACM Digital Library","","21","Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular paradigm for addressing sequential decision tasks in which the agent has only limited environmental feedback. Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL) in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL curriculum learning research.","","","","","","transfer learning, reinforcement learning, curriculum learning","JMLR.org","1532-4435","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"
"Predicting student performance in interactive online question pools using mouse interaction features","Wei, Huan and Li, Haotian and Xia, Meng and Wang, Yong and Qu, Huamin","","2020","ACM Digital Library","645–654","","Modeling student learning and further predicting the performance is a well-established task in online learning and is crucial to personalized education by recommending different learning resources to different students based on their needs. Interactive online question pools (e.g., educational game platforms), an important component of online education, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, most existing work on student performance prediction targets at online learning platforms with a well-structured curriculum, predefined question order and accurate knowledge tags provided by domain experts. It remains unclear how to conduct student performance prediction in interactive online question pools without such well-organized question orders or knowledge tags by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to boost student performance prediction in interactive online question pools by further considering student interaction features and the similarity between questions. Specifically, we introduce new features (e.g., think time, first attempt, and first drag-and-drop) based on student mouse movement trajectories to delineate students' problem-solving details. In addition, heterogeneous information network is applied to integrating students' historical problem-solving information on similar questions, enhancing student performance predictions on a new question. We evaluate the proposed approach on the dataset from a real-world interactive question pool using four typical machine learning models. The result shows that our approach can achieve a much higher accuracy for student performance prediction in interactive online question pools than the traditional way of only using the statistical features (e.g., students' historical question scores) in various models. We further discuss the performance consistency of our approach across different prediction models and question classes, as well as the importance of the proposed interaction features in detail.","","10.1145/3375462.3375521","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3375462.3375521","","","student performance prediction, question pool, mouse movement trajectory, heterogeneous information network","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"

However, it is not easy for instructors to monitor students' wakefulness. In order to improve learning efficacy, accurate estimation of wakefulness is needed. In this study, we propose a multimodal wakefulness estimation method based on face and body movement information. We utilize web-cameras to obtain facial and head (face-head) movements and pressure mats for body movements, the latter of which can record the distribution of upper body pressure while watching video lectures. To confirm the effectiveness of multimodal data for wakefulness estimation, we conducted an experiment to collect data from students as they engaged in e-learning and their level of wakefulness was annotated in one-second windows. We extracted 45 features from face-head movements, and 80 features from seat pressure data. Two types of fusion methods, early and decision level fusion were applied, and the late fusion approach achieved an average F1-macro score of 0.70 in three levels of wakefulness estimation, which is higher than the unimodal approach. This result indicates that fusion of facial images and seat pressure features can be effective for learner wakefulness estimation.","","10.1145/3410530.3414386","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3410530.3414386","","","wakefulness, pressure sensor, facial expression, e-learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"

To the best of our knowledge, the analyzed sensor measures comprise the most diverse set of features from a variety of modalities that have to date been investigated in the e-learning domain. Our focus lies on predicting the subjectively reported CL and difficulty as well as intrinsic content difficulty based on the explored features. A study with 21 participants, who learned through videos and quizzes in a Moodle environment, shows that classifying intrinsic content difficulty works better for quizzes than for videos, where participants actively solve problems instead of passively consuming videos. Regression analysis for predicting the subjectively reported level of CL and difficulty also works with very low error within content topics. Among the explored feature modalities, eye-based features yield the best results, followed by heart-based and then skin-based measures. Furthermore, combining multiple modalities results in better performance compared to using a single modality.

"A Knowledge-Model for AI-Driven Tutoring Systems","Baumgart, Andreas and Madany Mamlouk, Amir","Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","2021","Engineering Village","1 - 18","343","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">A powerful new complement to traditional synchronous teaching is emerging: intelligent tutoring systems. The narrative: A learner interacts with a digital agent. The agent reviews, selects and proposes individually tailored educational resources and processes - i.e. a meaningful succession of instructions, tests or groupwork. The aim is to make personal tutored learning the new norm in higher education - especially in groups with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. The challenge: Today, there are no suitable data that allow computer-agents to learn how to take reasonable decisions. Available educational resources cannot be addressed by a computer logic because up to now they have not been tagged with machine-readable information at all or these have not been provided uniformly. And what's worse: there are no agreed conceptual and structured models of what we understand by 'learning', how this model-to-be could be implemented in a computer algorithm and what those explicit decisions are that a tutoring system could take. So, a prerequisite for any future digital agent is to have a structured, computer-accessible model of 'knowledge'. This model is required to qualify and quantify individual learning, to allow the association of resources as learning objects and to provide a base to operationalize learning for AI-based agents. We will suggest a conceptual model of 'knowledge' based on a variant of Bloom's taxonomy, transfer this concept of cognitive learning objectives into an ontology and describe an implementation into a web-based database application. The approach has been employed to model the basics of abstract knowledge in engineering mechanics at university-level. This paper addresses interdisciplinary aspects ranging from a teaching methodology, the taxonomy of knowledge in cognitive science, over a database-application for ontologies to an implementation of this model in a Grails service. We aim to deliver this web-based ontology, its user-interfaces and APIs into a research network that qualifies AI-based agents for competence-based tutoring.<br/></div> © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/FAIA210474","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Education computing;Learning systems;Ontology;Taxonomies;User interfaces;Websites;","","09226389","English","Competence-based learning;Conceptual model;Educational resource;Knowledge concept;Ontology's;Taxonomy of knowledge;Tutoring system;WEB application;Web applications;Webs services;","45631.610486111","45631.61662037","Accepted"

"Enhancing the Intelligence of the Adaptive Learning Software through an AI assisted Data Analytics on Students Learning Attributes with Unequal Weight","Qu, Yanzhen and Ogunkunle, Olanrewaju","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","2021","Scopus","","2021-October","Along with the growing popularity of the adaptive learning platform software in STEM education programs, further enhancing the ability of the adaptive learning platform to support learning effectiveness has become a priority. A common goal of all the adaptive learning platform software is to identify gaps in a student's knowledge, and provide relevant learning materials based on the result of the assessment of the student's exiting knowledge towards to the targeted subject, to increase the learning effectiveness. However, the student's existing knowledge is only one learning attribute, and it cannot reflect all the aspects that have an impact to the student's learning effectiveness. A natural solution to overcome this weakness is to make the adaptive learning decision making algorithm capable to process the dataset of multiple learning attributes of the student efficiently. This paper presents a machine learning algorithm to efficiently process the dataset of a student's multiple learning attributes. The main enabling foundation for this new algorithm is a data structure called 'student learning attributes index' which represents every learning attribute as a tuple of three elements: the 'learning-attribute-If)', the 'weight' of the learning attribute among all the learning attributes, and the 'efficiency' of the contribution to the student's learning effectiveness made by the learning attribute. This study has applied unequal weight to each of the learning attributes, more accurately reflecting that different learning attributes will have different impacts on a student's learning effectiveness. This new algorithm enables various learning support applications to become more practical and accurate in supporting student learning.  © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637387","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123851190&doi=10.1109%2fFIE49875.2021.9637387&partnerID=40&md5=235764cb68795a10d8466c4ef563c3a0","","","","","","","Cited by: 4","45630.959386574","45631.484398148","Accepted"

The usage of AI-based systems and the Internet has brought numerous educational innovations for both teachers and students. With the online learning platforms grounded on AI techniques, 5G has revolutionized the teaching and learning methods by smooth and faster access to educational content. Students of foreign languages, especially English learners, can now use chatbots and intelligent tutoring systems to learn and practice their speaking and listening skills offline and online. With Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), the English learning process can now be interactive and productive. The students can now improve their language skills by conversing with AI-based agents instead of native speakers to avoid any fear and anxiety. The intelligent platforms can understand the consuming power of the student and hence can create and give content according to their level to create an individualized learning environment. With the help of digital assistants, people can also find it very easy and productive to improve English proficiency. To accomplish the goal of English teaching very easily and ideally, the teachers should use AI-based techniques in the classrooms. With the help of intelligent assistants for the daily workload of a teacher, we will be able to concentrate fully on the language learning and skills of the students.

While knowledge tracing models have been extensively studied in offline settings, very little work has explored their use in online settings. This is primarily because conducting experiments to evaluate and select knowledge tracing models in classroom settings is expensive. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel way of using machine-learning models to generate simulated students. We conduct experiments using agents generated by the Apprentice Learner Architecture to investigate the online use of different knowledge tracing models (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, the Streak model, and Deep Knowledge Tracing). An analysis of our simulation results revealed an error in the initial implementation of our Bayesian knowledge tracing model that was not identified in our previous work. Our simulations also revealed a more fundamental limitation of Deep Knowledge Tracing that prevents the model from supporting mastery learning on multi-step problems. Together, these two findings suggest that Apprentice agents provide a practical means of evaluating knowledge tracing models prior to more costly classroom testing. Lastly, our analysis identifies a positive correlation between the Bayesian knowledge tracing parameters estimated from human data and the parameters estimated from simulated learners. This suggests that model parameters might be initialized using simulated data when no human-student data is yet available. © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.","Conference paper","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174851599&partnerID=40&md5=50ac6e91b25c983a21ec28fe61e04c92","","","","","","","Cited by: 3","45630.959386574","45630.975636574","Duplicated"

In adaptive learning systems, knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis are critical techniques for predicting student performance. The traditional cognitive diagnosis model's terms are suitable for the student abilities analysis, but they rely on handcrafted interaction functions and only use student's response records so that it is difficult to capture the dynamic knowledge mastery ability of students. Although using the knowledge tracing to enhance cognitive diagnosis is a meaningful attempt towards towards capturing student performance, the RNN-based know-eledge tracing model have limited effect. This paper proposes a new model, named GKT-CD, which fuses knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis in a synergistic framework. In GKT-CD, we develop Gated-GNN to trace the student-knowledge response records and extract students' latent trait. And then, we use hierarchical structure in knowledge to construct exercise latent vector. At last, we use two-dimensional item response theory (IRT) to predict the probability of students answering exercises correctly. Extensive experiments conducted on realworld datasets show that the GKT-CD model is feasible and obtain excellent performance. © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533298","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116478799&doi=10.1109%2fIJCNN52387.2021.9533298&partnerID=40&md5=8f90b19e035dd6519afb42e6607c357d","","","","","","","Cited by: 11","45630.959386574","45630.973194444","Duplicated"

The framework is put forward by discussing the necessity and feasibility upon the combination of AI and education which is based on the model of student-centeredness. The knowledge graph and deep neural networks are applied into the learning-resource recommendation module, and the behavior detection module is based on deep learning technology which contributes to the multidimensional and comprehensive judgements of students. The results of the experiment and investigation show that the intelligent adaptive tutoring system has a certain ability to analyze students' weaknesses. Additionally, the behavior detection module can effectively analyze the status of students and put forward cautions. © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569273","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118928863&doi=10.1109%2fICCSE51940.2021.9569273&partnerID=40&md5=12d789a6e518202668940c307d7a2a69","","","","","","","Cited by: 1","45630.959386574","45630.971770833","Duplicated"

This can be leveraged to provide students with adaptive tutoring when doing a persuasive writing exercise. To test if individual tutoring for students’ argumentation will help them to write more convincing texts, we developed ArgueTutor, a conversational agent that tutors students with adaptive argumentation feedback in their learning journey. We compared ArgueTutor with 55 students to a traditional writing tool. We found students using ArgueTutor wrote more convincing texts with a better quality of argumentation compared to the ones using the alternative approach. The measured level of enjoyment and ease of use provides promising results to use our tool in traditional learning settings. Our results indicate that dialog-based learning applications combined with NLP text feedback have a beneficial use to foster better writing skills of students.","","10.1145/3411764.3445781","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3411764.3445781","","","pedagogical conversational agents, educational applications, argumentation learning, adaptive learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45631.555590278","Rejected"

"Designing Adaptive Argumentation Learning Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence","Wambsganss, Thiemo","","2021","ACM Digital Library","","","Argumentation skills are an omnipresent foundation of our daily communication and thinking. However, the learning of argumentation skills is limited due to the lack of individual learning conditions for students. Within this dissertation, I aim to explore the potential of adaptive argumentation skill learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) by designing, implementing, and evaluating new technology-enhanced pedagogical concepts to actively support students in developing the ability to argue in a structured, logical, and reflective way. I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.","","10.1145/3411763.3443422","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3411763.3443422","","","Adaptive Skill Learning, Argumentation Learning, Argumentation Mining, Pedagogical Conversational Agents","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45631.552974537","Rejected"

Thus, metaheuristics are usually employed to tackle this problem. This study aims to present a systematic review and mapping of the literature to identify, analyze, and classify the published solutions related to the ACS problem addressed by metaheuristics. We considered 61 studies in the mapping and 58 studies in the review from 2005 to 2018.

The multi-agent Observer system proposed in our paper supports students engaged in learning by monitoring their work and making suggestions based on the prediction of their final course success, using indicators of engagement and machine-learning algorithms. A novelty is that Observer collects data independently of the Moodle database, autonomously creates a training set, and learns from gathered data. Since the data are anonymized, researchers and lecturers can freely use them for purposes broader than that specified for Observer.

A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed.

"I-Quiz: An Intelligent Assessment Tool for Non-Verbal Behaviour Detection","Shobana, B.T. and Kumar, G.A. Sathish","Computer Systems Science and Engineering","2021","Scopus","1007 – 1021","40","Electronic learning (e-learning) has become one of the widely used modes of pedagogy in higher education today due to the convenience and flexibility offered in comparison to traditional learning activities. Advancements in Information and Communication Technology have eased learner connectivity online and enabled access to an extensive range of learning materials on the World Wide Web. Post covid-19 pandemic, online learning has become the most essential and inevitable medium of learning in primary, secondary and higher education. In recent times, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have transformed the current education strategy by offering a technology-rich and flexible form of online learning. A key component to assess the learner’s progress and effectiveness of online teaching is the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) assessment in most of the MOOC courses. Uncertainty exists on the reliability and validity of the assessment component as it raises a qualm whether the real knowledge acquisition level reflects upon the assessment score. This is due to the possibility of random and smart guesses, learners can attempt, as MCQ assessments are more vulnerable than essay type assessments. This paper presents the architecture, development, evaluation of the I-Quiz system, an intelligent assessment tool, which captures and analyses both the implicit and explicit non-verbal behaviour of learner and provides insights about the learner’s real knowledge acquisition level. The I-Quiz system uses an innovative way to analyse the learner non-verbal behaviour and trains the agent using machine learning techniques. The intelligent agent in the system evaluates and predicts the real knowledge acquisition level of learners. A total of 500 undergraduate engineering students were asked to attend an on-Screen MCQ assessment test using the I-Quiz system comprising 20 multiple choice questions related to advanced C programming. The non-verbal behaviour of the learner is recorded using a front-facing camera during the entire assessment period. The resultant dataset of non-verbal behaviour and question-answer scores is used to train the random forest classifier model to predict the real knowledge acquisition level of the learner. The trained model after hyperparameter tuning and cross validation achieved a normalized prediction accuracy of 85.68%. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

At all educational levels, on-site lecturing had to switch instantaneously to an online mode of instruction. This transition was so straightforward, that the argument could be made for online education to become a permanent fixture, particularly if it is more efficient, cheaper, and more effective than traditional education. Extensive meta-analyses, however, show that most online teaching practices do not lead to better educational outcomes than the on-site alternatives. Worse yet, the traditional face-to-face mode of lecturing is ineffective in the absence of personalized interactions. The proposed solutions are offered by artificial intelligence research, including virtual reality, intelligent tutoring systems, and serious games-solutions that have so far not been extensively implemented in practice.

"Verification of usefulness of student modeling with real educational data using convex factorization machines","Oeda, Shinichi and Shimizu, Daiki","Procedia Computer Science","2021","Scopus","804 – 811","192","Extracting useful information generated from educational settings involves the application of data mining, machine learning, and statistics to the large amount of electronic data collected by educational systems. To generate better higher learning outcomes using an intelligent tutoring system, such as an e-learning system, it is necessary to more accurately understand the state of student knowledge. The purpose of student modeling is to estimate the students' skills from log data, such as examination results, and to predict whether or not a student will be able to solve a problem. In this study, we propose a student performance prediction method using convex factorization machines. Factorization machines offer a combination of the advantages of support vector machines and factorization models such as matrix factorization. The results of conventional methods, which predict student performance using factorization machines, exhibited better results than they have before. However, because factorization machines are not convex optimizations, they acquire local minima, which is a disadvantage. Therefore, we used convex factorization machines in order to improve the performance of student modeling predictions. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient's medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions: By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide.  © 2021 Raffaello Furlan, Mauro Gatti, Roberto Menè, Dana Shiffer, Chiara Marchiori, Alessandro Giaj Levra, Vincenzo Saturnino, Enrico Brunetta, Franca Dipaola.","Article","10.2196/24073","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104150902&doi=10.2196%2f24073&partnerID=40&md5=58472015a9d71e929b204f33b773715b","","","","","","","Cited by: 19; All Open Access, Gold Open Access, Green Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.484930556","Rejected"

"Maya: An artificial intelligence based smart toy for pre-school children","Mevlüde Akdeniz and Fatih Özdinç","International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction","2021","ScienceDirect","100347","29","Toys are valuable educational tools that, while entertaining, they also help in childhood development. Traditional instructional materials do not adequately take into account children’s individual development abilities. New instructional materials should be developed so that children can obtain education in accordance with their own learning pace and learning processes. The possible benefits to be drawn from smart devices that cater to more than one sensory organ simultaneously and the inferences to be drawn from scenarios utilizing such instructional materials are amazing. The aim of this study was to develop a smart toy using artificial intelligence in order to support the concept development of preschool children in terms of numbers, shapes, animals and colors. In this study, the design and development process of the smart toy Maya is explained. Maya is a humanoid robot that supports children in learning at their own pace and can determine what and how to teach and to which child. It is an intelligent tutoring system that can perform image processing and natural language processing in the teaching process. Maya is being able to recognize its user, to interact, and to manage learning activities according to the learning speed of the child. A design-based research method was used in the study. A needs analysis was conducted during the design phase of the smart toy, and the attributes that a toy should provide to help the acquisition of the concept by children were determined. A toy prototype was developed within the framework of the determined criteria. Preschool teachers were interviewed about the prototype toy. Improvements were made to the toy in response to its perceived flaws as well as other feedback, and the second iteration of the smart toy was developed. The toy’s shortcomings were discovered through interviews and were then removed, and the toy was given its final form. An interactive smart toy which can be used for both individual and group activities was developed at the end of research. In this study, the educational, hardware and software components of the smart toy are emphasized, and a framework for the smart toy design and the development process is provided.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100347","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221286892100060X","","","Smart toys, Artificial intelligence, Concept teaching, Pre-school children, Educational robots","","2212-8689","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Chapter 1 - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled remote learning and teaching using Pedagogical Conversational Agents and Learning Analytics","Amara Atif and Meena Jha and Deborah Richards and Ayse A. Bilgin","","2021","ScienceDirect","3-29","","Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have potentially created new ways to teach and learn, such as the use of Learning Analytics (LA) to monitor and support students using data captured in Learning Management Systems (LMS). To add human rather than data-based support, in this chapter, we present our use of AI-enabled Pedagogical Conversational Agents (CAs) over the past 12 months in multiple units/subjects across two universities. These CAs play a role similar to a teacher or peer learner by sharing the expertise they have acquired from the knowledge contained in student–teacher social interactions in LMS forums and grade book teacher feedback. Unlike teachers or peers, these CAs can be contacted anonymously at any time, they don’t mind being asked the same question repeatedly and they can empower students to explore options and outcomes. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the potential of LA to automate CA interactions.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-823410-5.00013-9","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128234105000139","","","Pedagogical conversational agents, learning analytics, artificial intelligence, higher education, remote teaching and learning, student engagement, learning management system","Academic Press","","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Affective state and learning environment based analysis of students’ performance in online assessment","Parneet Kaur and Harish Kumar and Sakshi Kaushal","International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering","2021","ScienceDirect","12-20","2","Online learning and assessments have become an integral part of education systems around the world. Online education and learning stand out as one of the important applications of cognitive computing where artificial intelligence - based models can be built by taking into account cognitive abilities of the students such as working memory, retention power, reasoning skills etc. The systems used for online assessment can be better designed considering some factors effecting learning environments and cognitive abilities of the learners. These factors such as sleep hours, time of the day, noise level, environment settings and mood etc. are closely linked with his/ her cognitive skills and affective state which in turn may effect performance in online assessment. This paper attempts to identify the effect of mood, sleep hours, time of the day and energy level on the performance of engineering students in an online assessment in India. The students have attempted the test on Moodle (2.9.0) in three sessions in a day viz. morning, afternoon and late afternoon. Sleep hours and energy level have been captured using a set of questions embedded within the online test items. Mood has been captured by the pictorial representation of various moods using robotic characters during the test. One -way ANOVA has been used as statistical measure to test various hypotheses. The study reported that sleep hours and perceived energy level during various times of the day had no significant effect on the performance of students. However, mood and time of the day had an impact on the students’ performance. Higher number of students performed the best in the morning hours of the day. Also, students with positive moods performed better than students who reported negative mood. The findings from this study can be used for designing a framework of an adaptive tutor based on cognitive skills for teaching different subjects to students.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcce.2020.12.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666307420300279","","","Online assessment, Mood, Sleep hours, Energy level, Time of the day, Performance, Cognitive skills","","2666-3074","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"Chapter 6 - A literature review on artificial intelligence and ethics in online learning","Joan Casas-Roma and Jordi Conesa","","2021","ScienceDirect","111-131","","In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in online learning to improve teaching and learning, with the aim of providing a more efficient, purposeful, adaptive, ubiquitous, and fair learning experiences. However, and as it has been seen in other contexts, the integration of AI can have unforeseen consequences with detrimental effects which can result in unfair and discriminatory decisions. Therefore it is worth thinking about potential risks that learning environments integrating AI systems might pose. This work explores the intersections between AI, online learning, and ethics in order to understand the ethical concerns surrounding this crossroads. We review the main ethical challenges identified in the literature and distill a set of guidelines to support the ethical design and integration of AI systems in online learning environments. This should help ensure that online learning is how is meant to be: accessible, inclusive, fair, and beneficial to society.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-823410-5.00006-1","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128234105000061","","","artificial intelligence in education, artificial intelligence, data science, learning analytics, ethics, artificial morality, online learning","Academic Press","","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

With a distinctive rise in e-learning, teaching methods are being undertaken remotely on digital platforms due to COVID-19. To reduce the effect of this pandemic on the education sector, most of the educational institutions are already conducting online classes. However, to make these digital learning sessions interactive and comparable to the traditional offline classrooms, it is essential to ensure that students are properly engaged during online classes. In this paper, we have presented novel deep learning based algorithms that monitor the student’s emotions in real-time such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. This is done by the proposed novel state-of-the-art algorithms which compute the Mean Engagement Score (MES) by analyzing the obtained results from facial landmark detection, emotional recognition and the weights from a survey conducted on students over an hour-long class. The proposed automated approach will certainly help educational institutions in achieving an improved and innovative digital learning method.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2021.107277","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790621002597","","","Digital learning, Deep learning, COVID-19, Engage Detection, Emotion recognition, Engagement detection","","0045-7906","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Chapter 4 - Sequential engagement-based online learning analytics and prediction","Xiangyu Song and Jianxin Li","","2021","ScienceDirect","71-89","","In recent years, online education has become a widely accepted method of teaching and learning. It can be seen as an integrated learning platform that provides learning materials and assessment tools. With a complete record of students’ complete activities on the platform, it is possible to analyze and predict students’ learning engagement and assessment results well. However, new challenges have emerged. Various new forms of interactions have been introduced into e-learning platforms, allowing more implicit learning patterns to be learned. Students’ online activities have been shown to be closely related to their final performance. Therefore how to simulate their activities and accurately predict their final performance in the new forms of teaching and learning has become an important research topic in learning analytics. In this chapter, we will explain in detail how to model students’ sequential learning engagement using the latest research methods to accurately predict their academic performance.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-823410-5.00012-7","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128234105000127","","","Adaptive and intelligent educational systems, learning analytics, educational data mining, sequential engagement, deep learning","Academic Press","","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

They aim at providing online education to an increasingly large and heterogeneous audience: school pupils, university students or professionals who intend to acquire or develop their skill to better respond to market needs. The growing number of learners (more than 100 million globally at the moment, https://www.classcentral.com/report/mooc-stats-2019/) and courses (over 11 thousand, ibidem) reveals new and unprecedented scenarios in lifelong learning paths. Offering educational products to such an audience requires producers – not only private individuals but also public entities – to evaluate new teaching methods and methodologies for distance learning, in order to encourage participation and reduce their dropping out.

Academic help-seeking is a quite prevalent phenomenon that supports students to learn knowledge and improve academic performance. This study is aiming to understand learners and associate their performances via exploiting academic help-seeking moods with online learning of institutional education setting. Adopting the relevant theories, we propose a novel research model and identify three different online help-seeking moods, which are namely goal-directed seeker, exploratory seeker and avoidant seeker. Goal-directed seekers are described with preference for more challenging assignments and more posting on the platform discussion board frequently. Exploratory seekers hold the highest achievements during all help-seeking moods. Avoidant seekers are well-distinguished by holding the lowest frequency of posting among all moods and the most average time spent on the platform. Students have collective preferences for assignment submission in each help-seeking mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping academic grade significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first work that characterizes the help-seeking moods and associates moods with the enrollment performance for online education of institutional student.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.09.163","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921019025","","","Help-seeker, Information Seeking, Online learning, Academic Resources, Education Informatization","","1877-0509","","Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference KES2021","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

"Prerequisite-aware course ordering towards getting relevant job opportunities","Yiling Dai and Masatoshi Yoshikawa and Kazunari Sugiyama","Expert Systems with Applications","2021","ScienceDirect","115233","183","Adapting learning experience according to the rapidly-changing job market is essential for students to achieve fruitful learning and successful career development. As building blocks of potential job opportunities, we focus on “technical terminologies” which are frequently required in the job market. Given a technical terminology, we aim at identifying an order of courses which contributes to the acquisition of knowledge about the terminology and also follows the prerequisite relationships among courses. To solve the course ordering problem, we develop a two-step approach, in which course-terminology relatedness is first estimated and then courses are ordered based on the prerequisite relationships and the estimated relatedness. Focusing on the second step, we propose a method based on Markov decision process (MDPOrd) and compare it with three other methods: (1) a method that orders courses based on aggregated relatedness (AggRelOrd), (2) a method that topologically sorts the courses based on personalized PageRank values (PageRankTS), and (3) a method that greedily picks courses based on the average relatedness (GVPickings). In addition to evaluating how the order prioritizes the related courses, we also evaluate from pedagogical perspectives, namely, how the order prioritizes specifically/generally fundamental courses, and how it places courses close to their prerequisites. Experimental results on two course sets show that MDPOrd outperforms the other methods in prioritizing related courses. In addition, MDPOrd is effective in ordering courses close to their prerequisites, but does not work well in highly ranking fundamental courses in the order.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115233","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421006655","","","Course ordering, Prerequisite, Job opportunity, Technical terminology, Markov decision process, Pedagogical perspectives","","0957-4174","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Online learning: A comprehensive survey","Steven C.H. Hoi and Doyen Sahoo and Jing Lu and Peilin Zhao","Neurocomputing","2021","ScienceDirect","249-289","459","Online learning represents a family of machine learning methods, where a learner attempts to tackle some predictive (or any type of decision-making) task by learning from a sequence of data instances one by one at each time. The goal of online learning is to maximize the accuracy/correctness for the sequence of predictions/decisions made by the online learner given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction/learning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to traditional batch or offline machine learning methods that are often designed to learn a model from the entire training data set at once. Online learning has become a promising technique for learning from continuous streams of data in many real-world applications. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the online machine learning literature through a systematic review of basic ideas and key principles and a proper categorization of different algorithms and techniques. Generally speaking, according to the types of learning tasks and the forms of feedback information, the existing online learning works can be classified into three major categories: (i) online supervised learning where full feedback information is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback, and (iii) online unsupervised learning where no feedback is available. Due to space limitation, the survey will be mainly focused on the first category, but also briefly cover some basics of the other two categories. Finally, we also discuss some open issues and attempt to shed light on potential future research directions in this field.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.04.112","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221006706","","","Online learning, Online convex optimization, Sequential decision making","","0925-2312","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"15 - Envisioning Education 4.0—A scenario planning approach to predicting the future","Martin Hamilton","","2021","ScienceDirect","267-283","","What could the future of education look like for libraries, those who run them, and their patrons? In this chapter, we will look at some key trends and how they could play out using a scenario planning approach, and model the potential impact on key actors and our institutions themselves. We will introduce the scenario planning methodology originally developed by Shell in the 1970s and subsequently adopted by groups as diverse as the fashion industry (Forum for the Future, 2019), the International Olympic Committee (IOC, 2020), and the UK’s Government Office for Science (GO-Science, 2017). We will specifically address the extent to which the delivery of education could be transformed by Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies—and what the resulting ‘Education 4.0’ paradigm might look like. Will most universities and colleges as we know them to cease to exist, with everyone having the chance to earn an online qualification from one of the world’s most prestigious institutions or study for a widely respected industry-led certification? Or will formal education become even more vital because of the advanced skills required for careers in areas such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence?","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-822144-0.00015-X","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012822144000015X","","","Education 4.0, Industry 4.0, Scenario planning, Innovation, Technological change","Chandos Publishing","","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"A systematic literature review of supply chain decision making supported by the Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics","Martijn Koot and Martijn R.K. Mes and Maria E. Iacob","Computers & Industrial Engineering","2021","ScienceDirect","107076","154","The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2020.107076","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835220307464","","","Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Supply chain management, Decision making, Systematic literature review","","0360-8352","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"CLSA: A novel deep learning model for MOOC dropout prediction","Qian Fu and Zhanghao Gao and Junyi Zhou and Yafeng Zheng","Computers & Electrical Engineering","2021","ScienceDirect","107315","94","MOOCs have attracted hundreds of millions of learners with advantages such as being cost-free and having flexible time and space. However, high dropout rates have become the main issue that hinders their further progress. To solve this problem, this research proposes a pipeline model named CLSA to predict the dropout rate based on learners’ behavior data. The CLSA model first uses a convolutional neural network to extract local features and builds feature relations using a kernel strategy. Then, it feeds this high-dimensional vector generated by the CNN to a long short-term memory network to obtain a time-series incorporated vector representation. After that, it employs a static attention mechanism on the vector to obtain an attention weight on each dimension. When tested on the KDD CUP 2015 dataset, our model reached 87.6% accuracy, which was higher than the previous best model (over 2.8%). The F1-score of our model reached 86.9%, which was 1.6% higher than the previous state-of-the-art result.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2021.107315","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790621002901","","","Massive open online courses, Dropout prediction, Convolutional neural network, Long short-term memory network, Attention mechanism","","0045-7906","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Time-and-Concept Enhanced Deep Multidimensional Item Response Theory for interpretable Knowledge Tracing","Yu Su and Zeyu Cheng and Pengfei Luo and Jinze Wu and Lei Zhang and Qi Liu and Shijin Wang","Knowledge-Based Systems","2021","ScienceDirect","106819","218","Knowledge Tracing (KT), namely tracking the knowledge conditions of each student across time, has always been challenging due to the latent and time-varying characteristics of knowledge states. Traditional psychometrical frameworks lack the ability to extract rich representations of exercises or examinees. Deep learning KT models have shown comparable performances, but uninterpretable model parameters have limited their applications. Furthermore, existing frameworks usually cannot handle temporal factors appropriately, as most of them simply apply stochastic processes to simulate fluctuations on knowledge states over time. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Time-and-Concept Enhanced Deep Multidimensional Item Response Theory (TC-MIRT) that integrates the parameters of a Multidimensional Item Response Theory into an improved recurrent neural network. Specifically, two enhanced components are constructed to empower our model with the ability to perform trend forecasting and to generate explainable parameters in each specific domain of knowledge. Experiments implemented on two real-world datasets show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art KT approaches on performance prediction tasks. Moreover, extensive case analyses also demonstrate that the interpretable parameters of TC-MIRT can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of students.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.106819","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705121000824","","","Knowledge Tracing, Recurrent neural network, Interpretable machine learning, Item Response Theory","","0950-7051","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

McNamara and Mihai Carabas and Traian Rebedea and Stefan Trausan-Matu","Computers in Human Behavior","2021","ScienceDirect","106780","121","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the entire world, while the impact and usage of online learning environments has greatly increased. This paper presents a new version of the ReaderBench framework, grounded in Cohesion Network Analysis, which can be used to evaluate the online activity of students as a plug-in feature to Moodle. A Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM cells that combines global features, including participation and initiation indices, with a time series analysis on timeframes is used to predict student grades, while multiple sociograms are generated to observe interaction patterns. Students’ behaviors and interactions are compared before and during COVID-19 using two consecutive yearly instances of an undergraduate course in Algorithm Design, conducted in Romanian using Moodle. The COVID-19 outbreak generated an off-balance, a drastic increase in participation, followed by a decrease towards the end of the semester, compared to the academic year 2018–2019 when lower fluctuations in participation were observed. The prediction model for the 2018–2019 academic year obtained an R2 of 0.27, while the model for the second year obtained a better R2 of 0.34, a value arguably attributable to an increased volume of online activity. Moreover, the best model from the first academic year is partially generalizable to the second year, but explains a considerably lower variance (R2 = 0.13). In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis of changes in student behaviors using comparative sociograms further supported conclusions that there were drastic changes in student behaviors observed as a function of the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106780","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563221001035","","","Cohesion Network Analysis, Moodle, Click-stream data, Sociograms, Learning patterns, Student behavior, Learner interactions","","0747-5632","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

A total of eight physics teachers participated in this study. Data sources included observations of online classes, interviews with the teachers, and lesson materials. Data analysis was informed by social practice theory and literature on online learning. As a result, teachers’ practices were distinguished based on teaching emphases including content explanation, participatory learning, and independent first-hand experience. Through the application of various technological tools, teaching practices varied in terms of the degree of interactions and student self-directedness. Three essential practices of physics teaching, defined as those preserved from on-site teaching, were identified. Those features reflected the nature of schooling and the subject matter. The teachers were found to have professional development opportunities through online teaching experiences. Implications for professional development and further research topics are suggested.

"Enhancing topic-detection in computerized assessments of constructed responses with distributional models of language","José Á. Martínez-Huertas and Ricardo Olmos and José A. León","Expert Systems with Applications","2021","ScienceDirect","115621","185","Usually, computerized assessments of constructed responses use a predictive-centered approach instead of a validity-centered one. Here, we compared the convergent and discriminant validity of two computerized assessment methods designed to detect semantic topics in constructed responses: Inbuilt Rubric (IR) and Partial Contents Similarity (PCS). While both methods are distributional models of language and use the same Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) prior knowledge, they produce different semantic representations. PCS evaluates constructed responses using non-meaningful semantic dimensions (this method is the standard LSA assessment of constructed responses), but IR endows original LSA semantic space coordinates with meaning. In the present study, 255 undergraduate and high school students were allocated one of three texts and were tasked to make a summary. A topic-detection task was conducted comparing IR and PCS methods. Evidence from convergent and discriminant validity was found in favor of the IR method for topic-detection in computerized constructed response assessments. In this line, the multicollinearity of PCS method was larger than the one of IR method, which means that the former is less capable of discriminating between related concepts or meanings. Moreover, the semantic representations of both methods were qualitatively different, that is, they evaluated different concepts or meanings. The implications of these automated assessment methods are also discussed. First, the meaningful coordinates of the Inbuilt Rubric method can accommodate expert rubrics for computerized assessments of constructed responses improving computer-assisted language learning. Second, they can provide high-quality computerized feedback accurately detecting topics in other educational constructed response assessments. Thus, it is concluded that: (1) IR method can represent different concepts and contents of a text, simultaneously mapping a considerable variability of contents in constructed responses; (2) IR method semantic representations have a qualitatively different meaning than the LSA ones and present a desirable multicollinearity that promotes the discriminant validity of the scores of distributional models of language; and (3) IR method can extend the performance and the applications of current LSA semantic representations by endowing the dimensions of the semantic space with semantic meanings.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115621","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421010150","","","Inbuilt rubric, Constructed responses, Summaries, Topic detection, Latent semantic analysis, Automated summary evaluation","","0957-4174","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Feedback provides insights into the assistance of learners in terms of achieving learning goals and improving self-regulated skills. In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this context, feedback allows the instructor to customize learning content according to the students' needs. However, giving feedback is a challenging task for instructors, especially in contexts of large cohorts. As a result, several automatic feedback systems have been proposed to reduce the workload on the part of the instructor. Although these systems have started gaining research attention, there have been limited studies that systematically analyze the progress achieved so far as reported in the literature. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review on automatic feedback generation in learning management systems. The main findings of this review are: (1) 65.07% of the studies demonstrate that automatic feedback increases student performance in activities; (2) 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload; (3) 82.53% of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than automatic feedback; and (4) the main method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a desired answer in some subject (such as logic circuits or programming).","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100027","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000217","","","Educational feedback, Automatic feedback, Systematic review, Online learning environments","","2666-920X","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Cross-subject EEG emotion classification based on few-label adversarial domain adaption","Yingdong Wang and Jiatong Liu and Qunsheng Ruan and Shuocheng Wang and Chen Wang","Expert Systems with Applications","2021","ScienceDirect","115581","185","Emotion classification signal based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important part of big data associated with health. One of the main challenges in this regard is the varying patterns of EEG indifferent subjects. Domain adaptation is an effective method to reduce the data difference between the source domain and the target domain. However, it is an enormous challenge to make a discriminator-based domain adaptation with a small target data and transform the target domain to the source domain. In the present study, a novel method called “few-label adversarial domain adaption” (FLADA) is proposed for cross-subject emotion classification tasks with small EEG data. The proposed method involves three steps: (a) Selecting subjects of the close source domain forming an adapted list. Few labeled target data are tested based on each emotion model of the source subject to get the subject list of the source domain. (b)Training three models based on each selected subject and the target subject. Three loss functions and six groups’ dataset are designed to get a domain adaption model for each selected source subject. (c) Distilling all classifiers for classifying the target emotion. In general, the main purpose of the proposed method, which originates from the Meta-learning, is to find a feature representation that is broadly suitable for the target subject and source subject with limited labels. The proposed method can be applied to all deep learning oriented models. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried out on SEED and DEAP datasets, which are public datasets. It is found that with a small amount of target data, the proposed FLADA model outperforms the state-of-art methods in terms of accuracy and AUC-ROC.

This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104282","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521001597","","","Smart classroom, Systematic review, Socio-technological challenges, Technology-supported learning","","0360-1315","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

In this paper, we explore for the first time Bayesian deep learning on learner-based text posts with two methods: Monte Carlo Dropout and Variational Inference, as a new solution to assessing the need of instructor interventions for a learner’s post. We compare models based on our proposed methods with probabilistic modelling to its baseline non-Bayesian models under similar circumstances, for different cases of applying prediction. The results suggest that Bayesian deep learning offers a critical uncertainty measure that is not supplied by traditional neural networks. This adds more explainability, trust and robustness to AI, which is crucial in education-based applications. Additionally, it can achieve similar or better performance compared to non-probabilistic neural networks, as well as grant lower variance.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80421-3_10","","","Intelligent systems;Monte Carlo methods;Bayesian networks;Modeling languages;Natural language processing systems;Neural networks;Deep learning;E-learning;","","03029743","English","Bayesian model;Complex nature;Massive open online course;NAtural language processing;Non-probabilistic;Probabilistic modelling;Uncertainty measures;Variational inference;","45631.610497685","45631.610497685","Rejected"
"Including Learning Analytics in the Loop of Self-Paced Online Course Learning Design","Yan, Hongxin and Lin, Fuhua and Kinshuk","International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","2021","Engineering Village","878 - 895","31","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Online education is growing because of its benefits and advantages that students enjoy. Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer’s work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined.<br/></div> © 2020, The Author(s).","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-020-00225-z","","","Students;Online systems;Education computing;E-learning;Curricula;","","15604292","English","Academic performance;Computer Science course;Design strategies;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning barriers;Learning designs;On-line education;Student modelling;","45631.610497685","45631.610497685","Rejected"
"Assessing the Performance of Online Students - New Data, New Approaches, Improved Accuracy","Schmucker, Robin and Wang, Jingbo and Hu, Shijia and Mitchell, Tom M.","arXiv","2021","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">We consider the problem of assessing the changing performance levels of individual students as they go through online courses. This student performance modeling problem is a critical step for building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of how to utilize various types and large amounts of log data from earlier students to train accurate machine learning models that predict the performance of future students. This study is the first to use four very large sets of student data made available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for logistic regression based student performance modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve improved accuracy of student modeling by introducing new features that can be easily computed from conventional question-response logs (e.g., features such as the pattern in the student's most recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video segments the student watched, or skipped) as well as background information about prerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized student performance models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group prediction of the student performance. Taken together, these innovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808 compared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and also outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each diverse dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.<br/></div> Copyright © 2021, The Authors.

The traditional teaching method is to explain all the learning contents in a unified way. The setting of teaching contents and courseware are relatively fixed, which can not provide individualized choices for different learners. The core of the adaptive learning system based on feature extraction studied in this paper is that the system recommends personalized learning content for learners according to the learner model. To establish and personalize the self-adaptive learning engine mechanism, a personalized self-adaptive learning content presentation based on clustering is proposed.

It is built around the principle that learner outcomes, defined as what the learner is able to do and master after their learning experiences, are the ultimate measure for evaluation. This improves on earlier learning frameworks which focused on content authoring to develop curricula and instructor delivery techniques that relied heavily on standard grading systems, emphasizing testing only in terms of how much content was consumed and could be recalled by the learner. Thus, the focus was on instructor efficacy instead of on learner needs. A competency-based learning approach encourages tailoring the learning experiences to the learner and using evidence of learning to improve and adapt the learning components, which aligns well with adaptive instructional system approaches. The purpose of this paper is to further expand on competency-based learning, system and student evaluation, the assessment process, and how competency-based learning approaches may be applied to enhance and tailor adaptive instructional systems to achieve higher levels of learning based on individual outcomes. Additionally, it will be shown that there is a close connection between competency-based learning, learning analytics, and adaptive learning systems.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77857-6_38","","","Education computing;Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Grading;","","03029743","English","Adaptive learning systems;Assessment process;Delivery techniques;Higher levels of learning;Instructional system;Learning experiences;Learning frameworks;Student evaluation;","45631.610497685","45631.610497685","Rejected"

The testing module, on the other hand, is used to assess and test the student's progress. The Learning Module requires text classification based on difficulty level to ensure that students have access to learning resources that are appropriate for their ability level.

"A Transfer Learning Framework for Human-Centric Deep Reinforcement Learning with Reward Engineering","Sanz Ausin, Markel","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global","2021","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and especially Deep RL (DRL), have shown outstanding performance in video games from Atari, Mario, to StarCraft. Most of the prior work on DRL followed the online learning approach, and has been applied to agent-centric tasks. However, adapting the DRL algorithms to work offline in real-life, human-centric applications generates significant challenges. Often, as building accurate simulations is challenging, the algorithm must learn from a static and fixed-size dataset of trajectories, as in the offline RL settings. In this work, we address three issues that have hindered offline DRL from being successfully applied to human-centric tasks, and we apply them to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) to improve online education systems with college students. First, in real-life applications, a noisy and delayed reward signal is commonplace, and can negatively impact the learning process or DRL algorithms. Second, the lack of communication between the agent and the students can make students not feel engaged or motivated to learn the content shown by the tutor. Third, RL policies are seldom transferable: a policy trained on one task does not perform well on a different task, even if the two are closely related. In this work, we explored the effectiveness of offline DRL for inducing pedagogical policies in two Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and combined it with novel algorithms that aim to overcome the delayed and noisy reward problems, improve the communication between the agent and the students, and make the policies generalizable and transferable between tutors. Our empirical results show that combining DRL with an algorithm to mitigate the delayed and noisy rewards issue can make students learn more and faster than an expert-crafted policy. We also show that combining an offline DRL policy with simple explanations improves communication between the tutor and the students, and results in improved learning. Finally, to address the lack of transferability of our policies, in this work, we developed a novel transfer learning framework that combines model-based RL with bisimulation metrics. Our results show that our generalization policy is able to learn from multiple different datasets, learning a shared latent space between the tasks. We developed a single robust and generic policy that combines both of our Intelligent Tutoring Systems into a single policy, and is effective at improving student learning.

However, many students end up failing or withdrawing from online courses, which makes it extremely crucial to identify those ""at risk"" students and inject necessary interventions to prevent them from dropping out. This study thus aims at exploring an efficient predictive model, using both behavioural and demographical data extracted from the anonymised Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). The predictive model was implemented through machine learning methods that included BART. The analytics indicates that the proposed model could predict the final result of the course at a finer granularity, i.e., classifying the students into Withdrawn, Fail, Pass, and Distinction, rather than only Completers and Non-completers (two categories) as proposed in existing studies. Our model’s prediction accuracy was at 80% or above for predicting which students would withdraw, fail and get a distinction. This information could be used to provide more accurate personalised interventions. Importantly, unlike existing similar studies, our model predicts the final result at the very beginning of a course, i.e., using the first assignment mark, among others, which could help reduce the dropout rate before it was too late.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80421-3_19","","","Machine learning;Computer aided instruction;Population statistics;Binary alloys;Predictive analytics;E-learning;","","03029743","English","Academic institutes;Machine learning methods;Online course;Open universities;Prediction accuracy;Predictive modeling;Student success;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

For example, the special care education e.g., deaf or hard hearing students, face more difficulties than in ordinary situations. These students either read the lips or have to see their interlocutor’s whole body, in order to understand what he/she is saying but this nowadays is almost inevitable. In the unlikely scenario that their school is open, all classroom participants including teacher must wear a face mask, while in distance learning they can see only a small window of their teacher and most likely only his/her face.

In adaptive learning systems, knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis are critical techniques for predicting student performance. The traditional cognitive diagnosis model's terms are suitable for the student abilities analysis, but they rely on handcrafted interaction functions and only use student's response records so that it is difficult to capture the dynamic knowledge mastery ability of students. Although using the knowledge tracing to enhance cognitive diagnosis is a meaningful attempt towards towards capturing student performance, the RNN-based know-eledge tracing model have limited effect. This paper proposes a new model, named GKT-CD, which fuses knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis in a synergistic framework. In GKT-CD, we develop Gated-GNN to trace the student-knowledge response records and extract students' latent trait. And then, we use hierarchical structure in knowledge to construct exercise latent vector. At last, we use two-dimensional item response theory (IRT) to predict the probability of students answering exercises correctly. Extensive experiments conducted on realworld datasets show that the GKT-CD model is feasible and obtain excellent performance.<br/></div> © 2021 IEEE.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533298","","","Graph neural networks;Cognitive systems;E-learning;Education computing;Graphic methods;Learning systems;","","","English","Adaptive learning systems;Cognitive diagnosis;Courseworks;Diagnosis model;Graph neural networks;Graph-based;Item response theory;Knowledge tracings;On-line education;Student performance;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

The usage of AI-based systems and the Internet has brought numerous educational innovations for both teachers and students. With the online learning platforms grounded on AI techniques, 5G has revolutionized the teaching and learning methods by smooth and faster access to educational content. Students of foreign languages, especially English learners, can now use chatbots and intelligent tutoring systems to learn and practice their speaking and listening skills offline and online. With Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), the English learning process can now be interactive and productive. The students can now improve their language skills by conversing with AI-based agents instead of native speakers to avoid any fear and anxiety. The intelligent platforms can understand the consuming power of the student and hence can create and give content according to their level to create an individualized learning environment. With the help of digital assistants, people can also find it very easy and productive to improve English proficiency. To accomplish the goal of English teaching very easily and ideally, the teachers should use AI-based techniques in the classrooms. With the help of intelligent assistants for the daily workload of a teacher, we will be able to concentrate fully on the language learning and skills of the students.

"Designing Educational Video Games and Intelligent Tutoring Systems for Drill-Based Training","Wen, Zikai","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global","2021","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Drill and practice is a well-received approach to repeatedly train learners' skills through a series of exercises and to reward them with corrective feedback. However, drill-based training may not improve learners' performance if its exercises are badly designed (e.g., not fun, not relevant to the learning goal, and becoming too difficult or too simple). To make drill-based training more effective, researchers have been designing two types of e-learning tools: educational video games to motivate learners to practice and intelligent tutoring systems to personalize the exercises. Nonetheless, the existing e-learning tools have two main problems: (1) not providing situational context for training, which limits learners' ability to apply previously learned knowledge and skills to real-life situations; (2) not designed for learners with specific learning disabilities (i.e., dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia).To design educational video games that provide situational context for training, I sought to leverage entertainment technologies (e.g., storytelling technology) and AI technologies (e.g., computer vision technology). I tackled two specific projects. The first project was to improve anti-phishing training by simulating actual phishing attacks in a role-playing game. The key design challenge was to design an intensive workplace atmosphere that is easy for learners to make mistakes but also keeps the pleasure of completing tasks. My approach was to design an interactive storyline about building business as a banker and to design tragic endings that are realistic but with a sense of black humor. The second project was to teach vocabulary for objects located in the player’s immediate vicinity. The key design challenge was to guide learners to interact with learning materials in the physical world. To meet this challenge, I designed a new selection highlighting mechanics for AR scenes and designed an AR progress bar to indicate players' selection progress. Evaluations showed that my two educational video games for training were fun and also improved learners' post-test performance in practice. To help learners with SLDs use math e-learning tools for math skills training, I started by conducting an interview study with teachers for SLDs to study the difficulties that learners with SLDs faced in using e-learning tools. According to the interview study findings, learners with SLDs needed teachers to help them manage negative emotions during drills and practice. However, teachers were often unavailable during students' independent exercises. Therefore, I designed an intelligent tutoring system that detects and mitigates learners' negative emotional behaviors. This system analyzes eye-gazing data together with other traditional input data to detect learners' negative emotional behaviors. I also designed four intervention methods to mitigate the negative emotional behaviors: (1) praising for correct steps to solve the problem, (2) providing hints, (2) switching to a simpler problem, and (4) offering brain breaks. I conducted a formative study with teachers for SLDs to refine the design of the intelligent tutoring system. Teachers agreed that this system would help learners with SLDs reduce negative emotional behaviors. They also suggested that the system, in the future, should personalize the detection of negative emotional behaviors to help students who have more severe learning disabilities.Overall, my dissertation answered three main research questions: (1) how to design educational video games that provide situational context to practice skills; (2) whether and how learners with SLDs have difficulties in using the existing e-learning tools to practice math skills; and (3) how should we design the e-learning tool to intelligently tutor learners with SLDs. At the end of my dissertation, I discuss the limitations of my doctoral work and propose potential future directions for designing","","","","","","Artificial intelligence;Computer aided instruction;Drills;E-learning;Education computing;Educational technology;Engineering education;Interactive computer graphics;Learning systems;Personnel training;Teaching;","","","English","Design challenges;E-learning tool;Educational video games;Emotional behavior;Intelligent tutoring;Learning disabilities;Simple++;Situational context;Teachers';Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Not much is known about barriers and facilitators that drive this disparity. The present study used focus groups and interviews to collect the views of 21 teachers taking part in preliminary evaluations of an adaptive learning system based on multimodal affect recognition for students with learning disabilities and autism. The system uses multimodal detection of affective state and scoring of performance to drive its adaptive selection of learning material. Five themes captured the teachers’ views of the system’s potential impact, especially regarding learning and engagement but also on factors that might influence adoption. These were: the potential of the system to transform their teaching practice; the ability of the system to impact on learning outcomes; the potential impact on teacher-student/peer to peer relationships; usability issues; and organisational challenges. Despite being highly motivated as volunteer testers, teachers highlighted barriers to adoption, which will need addressing. This finding underscores the importance of involving teachers and students in the design and development process.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77857-6_31","","","Diseases;Learning systems;","","03029743","English","Adaptive learning systems;Affect recognition;Barriers to adoption;Design and development process;Learning disabilities;Learning materials;Multimodal detection;Teaching practices;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

This is because we have acquired a 3D mental model from observing humans and interacting with them. This capacity easily achievable for humans is not systematic when it comes to computers. In this paper, we describe an approach that aims at estimating poses from video with the objective of reproducing the observed movements by a virtual avatar. We propose the fragmentation of submitted videos into series of RGB frames to process individually. We aim two main objectives in our work. First, we achieve the extraction of initial 2D joints coordinates using a method that predicts joint locations by part affinities (PAFs). Then we infer 3D joints coordinates based on a human full 3D mesh reconstruction approach supplemented by the previously estimated 2D coordinates. Secondly, we explore the reconstruction of a virtual avatar using the extracted 3D coordinates with the prospect to transfer human movements towards the animated avatar. This would allow to extract the behavioral dynamics of a human, allowing to detect some health problems, for instance in Alzheimer. Our approach consists of multiple subsequent stages that show better results in the estimation and extraction than similar solution due to this supplement of 2D coordinates. With the final extracted coordinates, we apply a transfer of the positions (per frame) to the skeleton of a virtual avatar in order to reproduce the movements extracted from the video.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80421-3_56","","","3D modeling;Computer vision;Three dimensional computer graphics;E-learning;Image reconstruction;Gesture recognition;","","03029743","English","2D coordinates;3D coordinates;Behavioral dynamics;Human movements;Joint locations;Similar solution;Virtual avatar;Virtual learning;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

With the rapid adoption of online learning systems (including learning management systems) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a need to ensure that the systems’ design can encourage and sustain students to actively use them to achieve the required learning objectives. We argue that it is possible to incorporate socially-oriented persuasive strategies in the design of online learning systems to support students’ engagement and improve learning outcomes. We integrated three socially-oriented persuasive strategies (upward social comparison, social learning and competition) with a learning management system used in a university course. The strategies were implemented as social visualizations, and we explored their influence on 628 students’ access to learning materials. We found that the three persuasive strategies implemented as social visualizations encouraged students to access more frequently the learning materials, and this increase in frequency correlated positively with their academic performance (final grade in a course).

However, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). This can impact seriously the business model of MOOCs. Nevertheless, MOOC research on learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, the umbrella question that this work tackles is if learner’s data can predict their purchasing decision (certification). Our fine-grained analysis attempts to uncover the latent correlation between learner activities and their decision to purchase. We used a relatively large dataset of 5 courses of 23 runs obtained from the less studied MOOC platform of FutureLearn to: (1) statistically compare the activities of non-paying learners with course purchasers, (2) predict course certification using different classifiers, optimising for this naturally strongly imbalanced dataset. Our results show that learner activities are good predictors of course purchasibility; still, the main challenge was that of early prediction. Using only student number of step accesses, attempts, correct and wrong answers, our model achieve promising accuracies, ranging between 0.81 and 0.95 across the five courses. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue.<br/></div> © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80421-3_20","","","Curricula;Large dataset;Classification (of information);E-learning;Sales;Students;","","03029743","English","Business modeling;Content providers;Early prediction;Fine-grained analysis;Imbalanced dataset;Massive open online course;Personalisation;Purchasing decisions;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

These platforms also bring incredible diversity of learners in terms of their traits. A research area called Author Profiling (AP in general; here, Learner Profiling (LP)), is to identify such traits about learners, which is vital in MOOCs for, e.g., preventing plagiarism, or eligibility for course certification. Identifying a learner’s trait in a MOOC is notoriously hard to do from textual content alone. We argue that to predict a learner’s academic level, we need to also be using other features stemming from MOOC platforms, such as derived from learners’ actions on the platform. In this study, we specifically examine time stamps, quizzes, and discussions.

While knowledge tracing models have been extensively studied in offline settings, very little work has explored their use in online settings. This is primarily because conducting experiments to evaluate and select knowledge tracing models in classroom settings is expensive. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel way of using machine-learning models to generate simulated students. We conduct experiments using agents generated by the Apprentice Learner Architecture to investigate the online use of different knowledge tracing models (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, the Streak model, and Deep Knowledge Tracing). An analysis of our simulation results revealed an error in the initial implementation of our Bayesian knowledge tracing model that was not identified in our previous work. Our simulations also revealed a more fundamental limitation of Deep Knowledge Tracing that prevents the model from supporting mastery learning on multi-step problems. Together, these two findings suggest that Apprentice agents provide a practical means of evaluating knowledge tracing models prior to more costly classroom testing. Lastly, our analysis identifies a positive correlation between the Bayesian knowledge tracing parameters estimated from human data and the parameters estimated from simulated learners. This suggests that model parameters might be initialized using simulated data when no human-student data is yet available.<br/></div> © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.","","","","","","Apprentices;Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Education computing;Embedded systems;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;","","","English","Bayesian knowledge tracings;Computational model of learning;Computational modelling;Deep knowledge;Knowledge tracings;Mastery learning;Models of learning;Parameters estimated;Simulated student;Tracing model;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Concomitantly, learner dropout, at any time during MOOC courses, is very high, whilst the number of learners completing (completers) is low. Urgent intervention and attention may alleviate this problem. Analysing and mining learner comments is a fundamental step towards understanding their need for intervention from instructors. Here, we explore a dataset from a FutureLearn MOOC course. We find that (1) learners who write many comments that need urgent intervention tend to write many comments, in general. (2) The motivation to access more steps (i.e., learning resources) is higher in learners without many comments needing intervention, than that of learners needing intervention. (3) Learners who have many comments that need intervention are less likely to complete the course (13%).

"Personal Learning Environments: looking back and looking forward","Attwell, Graham","","2021","ACM Digital Library","522–526","","In this paper I look back at the emergence of the idea of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and consider why they have failed to be widely adapted. I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits’ which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of ‘coping with finiteness’” and “seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity” as a response to the climate crisis.

"Exploring the Effects of Applying Learning Analytics for Teaching Procedural Skills in Health Sciences Education","Villagr\'{a}n, Ignacio","","2021","ACM Digital Library","299–302","","In Health Science Education (HSE), students must demonstrate technical skills in many procedures. However, traditional teaching methodologies limit the possibilities for personalized feedback from an instructor and generally do not allow students to achieve the required proficiency levels. Concerning this, technology has been installed as a learning resource with numerous benefits that allow new multidisciplinary lines of research, such as learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM). Both LA and EDM seek to improve educational practice based on the intensive use of educational data, such as analyzing online learning patterns, creating performance predictions, and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. There is a range of possibilities in applying LA and EDM in teaching procedural skills that have not yet been explored. For this reason, this study aims to answer (1) How the educational data explain the development of procedural skills in virtual environments to support the teaching-learning process in Health Science Education?; and (2) How automatic feedback and adaptive personalization affect the performance and instructional design of the procedural skills learning process of health science students? We expect that this study contributes to the field of technical skills learning mediated by technology in higher education by using the data provided by the interaction of students with virtual resources to support educational decision-making and optimize the teaching and learning processes in HSE.","","10.1145/3462204.3481799","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3462204.3481799","","","procedural skills, learning analytics, health science education, educational data mining, adaptative learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"
"You Really Need Help: Exploring Expert Reasons for Intervention During Block-based Programming Assignments","Dong, Yihuan and Shabrina, Preya and Marwan, Samiha and Barnes, Tiffany","","2021","ACM Digital Library","334–346","","In recent years, research has increasingly focused on developing intelligent tutoring systems that provide data-driven support for students in need of assistance during programming assignments. One goal of such intelligent tutors is to provide students with quality interventions comparable to those human tutors would give. While most studies focused on generating different forms of on-demand support, such as next-step hints and worked examples, at any given moment during the programming assignment, there is a lack of research on why human tutors would provide different forms of proactive interventions to students in different situations. This information is critical to know to allow the intelligent programming environments to select the appropriate type of student support at the right moment. In this work, we studied human tutors’ reasons for providing interventions during two introductory programming assignments in a block-based environment. Three human tutors evaluated a sample of 86 struggling moments identified from students’ log data using a data-driven model. The human tutors specified whether and why an intervention was needed (or not) for each struggling moment. We analyzed the expert tags and their consensus discussions and extracted three main reasons that made the experts decide to intervene: “missing key components to make progress”, “using wrong or unnecessary blocks”, “misusing needed blocks”, “having critical logic errors”, “needing confirmation and next steps”, and “unclear student intention”. We use six case studies to illustrate specific student code trace examples and the tutors’ reasons for intervention. We also discuss the potential types of automatic interventions that could address these cases. Our work sheds light on when and why students might need programming interventions. These insights contribute towards improving the quality of automated, data-driven support in programming learning environments.","","10.1145/3446871.3469764","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3446871.3469764","","","programming assignments, proactive intervention, novice programming, expert intervention, block-based environments","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"
"Why We Should Build Robots That Both Teach and Learn","Adamson, Timothy and Ghose, Debasmita and Yasuda, Shannon C. and Shepard, Lucas Jehu Silva and Lewkowicz, Michal A. and Duan, Joyce and Scassellati, Brian","","2021","ACM Digital Library","187–196","","In this paper, we argue in favor of creating robots that both teach and learn. We propose a methodology for building robots that can learn a skill from an expert, perform the skill independently or collaboratively with the expert, and then teach the same skill to a novice. This requires combining insights from learning from demonstration, human-robot collaboration, and intelligent tutoring systems to develop knowledge representations that can be shared across all three components. As a case study for our methodology, we developed a glockenspiel-playing robot. The robot begins as a novice, learns how to play musical harmonies from an expert, collaborates with the expert to complete harmonies, and then teaches the harmonies to novice users. This methodology allows for new evaluation metrics that provide a thorough understanding of how well the robot has learned and enables a robot to act as an efficient facilitator for teaching across temporal and geographic separation.","","10.1145/3434073.3444647","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3434073.3444647","","","robot tutoring, robot learning, musical robot, human-robot interaction, human-robot collaboration","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"
"Linguistic Skill Modeling for Second Language Acquisition","Zylich, Brian and Lan, Andrew","","2021","ACM Digital Library","141–150","","To adapt materials for an individual learner, intelligent tutoring systems must estimate their knowledge or abilities. Depending on the content taught by the tutor, there have historically been different approaches to student modeling. Unlike common skill-based models used by math and science tutors, second language acquisition (SLA) tutors use memory-based models since there are many tasks involving memorization and retrieval, such as learning the meaning of a word in a second language. Based on estimated memory strengths provided by these memory-based models, SLA tutors are able to identify the optimal timing and content of retrieval practices for each learner to improve retention. In this work, we seek to determine whether skill-based models can be combined with memory-based models to improve student modeling and especially retrieval practice performance for SLA. In order to define skills in the context of SLA, we develop methods that can automatically extract multiple types of linguistic features from words. Using these features as skills, we apply skill-based models to a real-world SLA dataset. Our main findings are as follows. First, incorporating lexical features to represent individual words as skills in skill-based models outperforms existing memory-based models in terms of recall probability prediction. Second, incorporating additional morphological and syntactic features of each word via multiple-skill tagging of each word further improves the skill-based models. Third, incorporating semantic features, like word embeddings, to model similarities between words in a learner’s practice history and their effects on memory also improves the models and appears to be a promising direction for future research.","","10.1145/3448139.3448153","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3448139.3448153","","","student modeling, second language acquisition, memory decay","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"
"Towards Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-AI Interaction: How Language Reflects What Students Perceive About a Virtual Teaching Assistant","Wang, Qiaosi and Saha, Koustuv and Gregori, Eric and Joyner, David and Goel, Ashok","","2021","ACM Digital Library","","","Building conversational agents that can conduct natural and prolonged conversations has been a major technical and design challenge, especially for community-facing conversational agents. We posit Mutual Theory of Mind as a theoretical framework to design for natural long-term human-AI interactions. From this perspective, we explore a community’s perception of a question-answering conversational agent through self-reported surveys and computational linguistic approach in the context of online education. We first examine long-term temporal changes in students’ perception of Jill Watson (JW), a virtual teaching assistant deployed in an online class discussion forum. We then explore the feasibility of inferring students’ perceptions of JW through linguistic features extracted from student-JW dialogues. We find that students’ perception of JW’s anthropomorphism and intelligence changed significantly over time. Regression analyses reveal that linguistic verbosity, readability, sentiment, diversity, and adaptability reflect student perception of JW. We discuss implications for building adaptive community-facing conversational agents as long-term companions and designing towards Mutual Theory of Mind in human-AI interaction.","","10.1145/3411764.3445645","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3411764.3445645","","","theory of mind, online education, online community, language analysis, human-AI interaction, conversational agent","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"

PAs are software constructs (digital ‘characters’) that offer aid and support to the learner based on the learner's needs and recognized affective state. Primary studies that involve interaction of the PA with human learners in online educational contexts, are retrieved and screened according to a set of criteria. The subset of publications finally retained are analyzed to estimate the (possible) recent trend in PA-related research and to answer a number of research questions referring to the form, the role, the context and the effectiveness of the PA. A sustained interest rather than a trend has emerged from this analysis; moreover, the typical study uses an animated PA to teach a class of Computer Science undergraduate students; in 3 out of 4 studies, positive learning outcomes are reported and attributed to the presence of the PA.

"Intelligent Technologies in E-Learning: Personalization and Interoperability","Ivanova, Tatyana and Terzieva, Valentina and Ivanova, Malinka","","2021","ACM Digital Library","176–181","","Many educational systems are focused predominantly on such an organization of the learning process to be uniform for all learners. This approach is not the best for many learners, especially for those with various difficulties or interests. Strategies for personalization and adaptation can increase the tutoring quality and ensure efficient learning for groups of learners with different needs, goals, or interests. Intelligent technologies can enable the personalization of the learning process. However, no one system can contain all the knowledge needed for all learners, so interoperability between e-learning systems is of greater importance. Standards are needed for ensuring interoperability, but they are not sufficient. This paper first analyzes and classifies sources for learning on the Internet. The findings help to develop a knowledge model needed for a personalized recommendation of web-based sources, complementary to the learning content that a well-organized intelligent educational system can propose to learners. Having in mind specifics of the ontologies needed for modeling the learning domain, a model of the ontological repository for storing ontologies that can be useful for building intelligent educational systems is suggested.

However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students’ needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students’ individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students’ science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both – meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students’ learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students’ learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students’ learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students’ learning – the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.

"Automatic Interpretable Personalized Learning","Prihar, Ethan and Haim, Aaron and Sales, Adam and Heffernan, Neil","","2022","ACM Digital Library","1–11","","Personalized learning stems from the idea that students benefit from instructional material tailored to their needs. Many online learning platforms purport to implement some form of personalized learning, often through on-demand tutoring or self-paced instruction, but to our knowledge none have a way to automatically explore for specific opportunities to personalize students' education nor a transparent way to identify the effects of personalization on specific groups of students. In this work we present the Automatic Personalized Learning Service (APLS). The APLS uses multi-armed bandit algorithms to recommend the most effective support to each student that requests assistance when completing their online work, and is currently used by ASSISTments, an online learning platform. The first empirical study of the APLS found that Beta-Bernoulli Thompson Sampling, a popular and effective multi-armed bandit algorithm, was only slightly more capable of selecting helpful support than randomly selecting from the relevant support options. Therefore, we also present Decision Tree Thompson Sampling (DTTS), a novel contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm that integrates the transparency and interpretability of decision trees into Thomson sampling. In simulation, DTTS overcame the challenges of recommending support within an online learning platform and was able to increase students' learning by as much as 10\% more than the current algorithm used by the APLS. We demonstrate that DTTS is able to identify qualitative interactions that not only help determine the most effective support for students, but that also generalize well to new students, problems, and support content. The APLS using DTTS is now being deployed at scale within ASSISTments and is a promising tool for all educational learning platforms.","","10.1145/3491140.3528267","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3491140.3528267","","","personalized learning, multi-armed bandits, intelligent tutoring systems, contextual bandits","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45631.527303241","Accepted"

Each student seeks an environment that is suitable for his needs, with personalized and adaptable content that allows him to have a more successful and meaningful learning experience. Learner profile is a structure comprising direct and indirect information of learner’s background, objectives, interest and preferences. Taking a leaner’s profile into account while designing courses is beneficial, and profile modeling is an essential method that seeks to provide a comprehensive representation of all factors linked to the user's attributes. In this paper we propose a machine learning model for predicting learner profile. It serves as a basis to a suitable user-centered adaptation of gamification and content.

"GameDKT: Deep knowledge tracing in educational games","Hooshyar, Danial and Huang, Yueh-Min and Yang, Yeongwook","Expert Systems with Applications","2022","Scopus","","196","Despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (DKT) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116670","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124696480&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.116670&partnerID=40&md5=f015085009dda90b3a585dbbd9be7f07","","","","","","","Cited by: 22","45630.959386574","45630.973206019","Duplicated"

"Considering Intelligent Tutoring Systems as Mass Customization of Digital Education","Gembarski, Paul Christoph and Hoppe, Lukas","Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering","2022","Scopus","935 – 942","","In the digital era, individualized educational services, e.g. distributed by intelligent tutoring systems, are becoming increasingly popular and important for life-long learning but also during the COVID pandemic as many universities had to switch to distance learning immediately. Intelligent tutoring systems simulate behavior and expertise of physical teachers and support learners individually. In addition to closed questions, which can be modeled simply as if-then statements or decision trees, the use of artificial intelligence enables more and more the implementation of open questions and poorly structured problems, which is of particular importance for e.g. engineering education. In order to make the learning experience authentic, it is important to understand the learners as individuals and to confront them with learning content and in-depth knowledge tailored to their needs and skills. If, e.g., a formative assessment shows that a certain content has not yet been internalized, the tutoring system must detect this and react accordingly. Since this largely corresponds to mass customizing the teaching process, the following article frames digital education with focus on intelligent tutoring systems in context with mass customization. For cracking the code of mass customizing digital education, the three mass customization key competences solution space development, robust process design as well as choice navigation are taken as reference to set up digital educational content. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","10.1007/978-3-030-90700-6_107","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119420174&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-90700-6_107&partnerID=40&md5=a25ccc7b44510987ede2e52257467070","","","","","","","Cited by: 1","45630.959386574","45630.972581019","Duplicated"

Since there have been a large number of KT models, we attempt to systematically investigate, compare and discuss different aspects of KT models to find out the differences between these models in order to better assist researchers in this field. The findings of this study have made substantial contributions to the progress of online education, which is especially relevant in light of the current global pandemic. As a result of the current expansion of deep learning methods over the last decade, researchers have been tempted to include deep learning strategies into KT research with astounding results. In this paper, we evaluate current research on deep learning-based KT in the main categories listed below. In particular, we explore (1) a granular categorisation of the technological solutions presented by the mainstream Deep Learning-based KT Models. (2) a detailed analysis of techniques to KT, with a special emphasis on Deep Learning-based KT Models. (3) an analysis of the technological solutions and major improvement presented by Deep Learning-based KT models.

To investigate how individual argumentation self-evaluation will help students write more convincing texts, we designed an intelligent argumentation writing support system called ArgumentFeedback based on nudging theory and evaluated it in a series of three qualitative and quantitative studies with a total of 83 students. We found that students who received a self-evaluation nudge wrote more convincing texts with a better quality of formal and perceived argumentation compared to the control group. The measured self-efficacy and the technology acceptance provide promising results for embedding adaptive argumentation writing support tools in combination with digital nudging in traditional learning settings to foster self-regulated learning. Our results indicate that the design of nudging-based learning applications for self-regulated learning combined with computational methods for argumentation self-evaluation has a beneficial use to foster better writing skills of students.","","10.1145/3555633","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3555633","","","adaptive learning, argumentation learning, digital nudging, educational applications","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45631.55587963","Rejected"

Scholars have found that students' self-regulated actions impact their academic success in an online learning environment. However, because traditional online learning systems cannot personalize feedback to the student's personality, most students have less chance to obtain helpful suggestions for enhancing their knowledge linked to their learning problems. This paper incorporated self-regulated online learning in the Physics classroom and used a personalized learning approach to help students receive proper learning paths and material corresponding to their learning preferences. This study conducted a quasi-experimental design using a quantitative approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning environment in secondary schools. The experimental group of students participated in self-regulated online learning with a personalized learning approach, while the control group participated in conventional self-regulated online learning. The experimental results showed that the experimental group's post-test and the learning-gain score of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Moreover, the results also suggested that the student's perceptions about the usefulness of learning suggestions, ease of use, goal setting, learning environmental structuring, task strategies, time management, self-evaluation, impact on learning, and attitude toward the learning environment are important predictors of behavioral intention to learn with the self-regulated online learning that integrated with the personalized learning approach. © 2022 The Authors","Article","10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100086","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133475417&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100086&partnerID=40&md5=20d863d7dbb53841b0be12fcafea8a06","","","","","","","Cited by: 35; All Open Access, Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.50400463","Rejected"
"Toward Reasoning-Based Recommendation of Library Items - A Case Study on the e-learning Domain","Ferilli, Stefano and Loop, Liza","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","2022","Scopus","","3160","A primary function of libraries and librarians is to deliver relevant, interesting and useful items to the library users. With the enormous increase and continuous expansion of digital library content, it is not feasible for the librarian manually to carry out this service, and automated systems are needed to identify the candidate items to propose, possibly to be further checked or filtered by the librarian. Standard recommendation techniques studied in the Artificial Intelligence literature may be unsuitable, both due to the complex specificities of the library domain, and to the need to explain the recommendations. We propose an approach based on formal reasoning and on advanced matching assessment functions, and discuss in this paper the matching function specifically. We show a sample application to the e-learning domain, where the library stores the learning objects and the users are students.

IT development is proven to positively affect the education area through the concept of electronic learning (e-learning). This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic where traditional classrooms teaching was transferred to e-learning. This technological development demands individuals to adapt to the advancement. Despite its benefits, technological advancement may affect the physical condition of e-learning users. When the e-learning users fail to adjust, they might have physical condition problems that cause depression. Therefore, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system to detect the physiological conditions of e-learning users. By implementing Fuzzy Tsukamoto as artificial intelligence on IoT technology, we can identify the physiological condition of e-learning users such as relaxed, calm, anxious, and stressed conditions. Structurally, the proposed system consists of three stages: 1) Sensor data acquisition, 2) Physiological condition detection using Fuzzy Tsukamoto, 3) Display the output directly to the website. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system in the task of detecting the physiological condition of the ten e-learning users. Based on experimental results, the proposed system presents 84.01% of accuracy. This result indicates that the proposed system is able to reliably detect physiological conditions on IoT-based e-learning users. By detecting psychological conditions, e-learning is expected to become an adaptive learning system so that it can adapt to the characteristics of each user. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","10.18178/ijiet.2022.12.7.1668","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131639213&doi=10.18178%2fijiet.2022.12.7.1668&partnerID=40&md5=4fb0d8a007d82d2d87ced5f04ee88280","","","","","","","Cited by: 2; All Open Access, Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.493854167","Rejected"

Accessibility to the Internet and computer systems has prompted the gravitation towards digital learning in medicine, including ophthalmology. Using the PubMed database and Google search engine, current initiatives in ophthalmology that serve as alternatives to traditional in-person learning with the purpose of enhancing clinical and surgical training were reviewed. This includes the development of teleeducation modules, construction of libraries of clinical and surgical videos, conduction of didactics via video communication, and the implementation of simulators and intelligent tutoring systems into clinical and surgical training programs. In this age of digital communication, teleophthalmology programs, virtual ophthalmological society meetings, and online examinations have become necessary for conducting clinical work and educational training in ophthalmology, especially in light of recent global events that have prevented large gatherings as well as the rural location of various populations. Looking forward, web-based modules and resources, artificial intelligence–based systems, and telemedicine programs will augment current curricula for ophthalmology trainees.","","https://doi.org/10.1097/APO.0000000000000484","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162098923007090","","","artificial intelligence, surgical simulation, tele-education, web-based learning","","2162-0989","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Developing an AI-based chatbot for practicing responsive teaching in mathematics","Dabae Lee and Sheunghyun Yeo","Computers & Education","2022","ScienceDirect","104646","191","Responsive teaching promotes students' mathematical reasoning and positive attitudes toward mathematics. Due to the complexity of the work of teaching, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been provided with approximated opportunities to practice responsive teaching skills in teacher education programs. Although increasing demand for adaptive learning reinforces the need for research on artificial intelligence (AI) in education, there have been few approaches that engaged learners in meaningful interactions. Our goal was to develop an AI-based chatbot that engaged PSTs in an authentic, meaningful, and open-ended teaching situation to enhance PSTs' responsive teaching skills, specifically questioning skills through approximations of practice. The chatbot was designed to act as a virtual student who displayed misconceptions on the topic of fractions. By employing design-based research, we examined 1) design features and structure of the chatbot, 2) coverage of users' input, 3) PSTs' questioning patterns, and 4) users' experiences. Two iterations of design, implementation and evaluation took place in an elementary mathematics education methods course. To build the chatbot we qualitatively analyzed the training data, categorized them into the smallest meaningful intents of users, and prepared corresponding responses to each intent. At the final iteration, the refined chatbot adequately covered PSTs’ questions and provided realistic responses. We found a pattern of PSTs asking similar questions repeatedly in the conversation data. Through multiple iterations, certain design features could lead to improved questioning patterns and user perceptions, including sequential responses, informing responses, and personification. Implications, design features, and limitations are discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104646","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131522002172","","","Elementary education, Improving classroom teaching, Pedagogical issues, Simulations, Teaching/learning strategies","","0360-1315","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Verifying student identity in oral assessments with deep speaker","Jake Renzella and Andrew Cain and Jean-Guy Schneider","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2022","ScienceDirect","100044","3","Contract cheating, a form of academic misconduct in which students outsource assessment activities to third parties, is a topic of concern among educators. As similarity-detection systems are ineffective at detecting contract cheating, some institutions have turned to intensely criticised proctoring systems, however student and educator bodies report high costs and privacy concerns. Oral assessment is an alternative assessment approach that provides valuable interpersonal and communication skills in graduates and can naturally help detect and deter cheating. However, oral assessment is typically time-consuming, and in larger courses, it is challenging to validate respondents' identity. Advancements in machine learning approaches can scale time-consuming tasks that previously required prohibitive educator effort. One such system, Deep Speaker, is a speaker identification and verification system that can verify if two audio samples resemble speech from the same person with high accuracy. This paper presents an innovative tool that integrates an online oral assessment tool, Real Talk, with Deep Speaker. This proposed system facilitates scalable student-tutor discussions while providing longitudinal student identity validation with minimal cost and impact for institutions and addressing student privacy concerns. We evaluated the system and showed that student audio responses collected via oral discussion tools are suitable for verification. We then discuss the impact our system may have when applied in higher education. We posit that institutions can use such approaches to detect cases of contract cheating, enhance learning outcomes, and pave the way for more student-friendly assessment and discussion models in online education.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100044","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000382","","","Academic integrity, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Audio feedback, Learning management systems","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Internet of Behaviour (IoB)-based AI models for personalized smart education systems","Ossama H. Embarak","Procedia Computer Science","2022","ScienceDirect","103-110","203","E-learning, remote learning systems, and hybrid models were necessary in the pandemics age and when cities are rapidly moving towards smart city status. Adaptive and individualized education is now a must to reduce the drawbacks of distance learning while ensuring high levels of accomplishment. Technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (XAI), and data mining are all helping to transform education in a smart city by allowing for personalized learning and the ability to tailor content based on individual preferences. Based on the combination of XAI and IoB technologies, this study proposes a new paradigm for smart educational systems. Using data on students' actions, researchers try to establish whether or not contemporary educational systems meet students' needs. Education systems have evolved, but not to the point where they can be personalized to meet the cognitive demands of students and assist them when face-to-face instruction isn't available. Using evaluation methods, the study found that there has been a shift in students' academic progress when monitoring using IoT/IoB to enable a relative response in support of their progression. The system response to learners was 37%, once we involve the IoB in the processes and let students and the system be aware of the collected and used data about students' behaviours, the student's response improved to 76 % . This indicates the major influence of IoB on learner assistance and system adaptations to their real demands for higher achievement.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.07.015","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922006202","","","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Internet of behaviour (IoB), Smart education, future AI-based education, Smart cities education, adaptive learning","","1877-0509","","17th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications / 19th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing / 12th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology (FNC/MobiSPC/SEIT 2022), August 9-11, 2022, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Enhancement of online education system by using a multi-agent approach","Nethra Viswanathan and Sofia Meacham and Festus Fatai Adedoyin","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2022","ScienceDirect","100057","3","Multi-Agent System (MAS) is popular in the fields where cooperative effort is required to fulfil the purpose of the end product. This study creates a Multi-Agent System as a potential solution for the implementation of an online education system in order to bring about swift and accurate responses from the system and thus a meaningful conversation between the learners and the system. The existing work on online education system employing MAS does not depict the means of flow of information from the browser to the internal MAS and also lacks the adaptivity element with respect to the changing demands of the learners. The study attempts to bridge this gap by employing a system with Event-Condition-Action model and intelligent agents which include a message passing agent to depict the means of message flow from the browser to the MAS and an adaptive course organiser agent which organises adaptive educational content with respect to the changing needs of the learner. The outcome of the study is the design and simulation of the said system as a standalone entity that can be attached to a virtual learning environment (VLE), with the addition of pedagogical agents performing different functionalities to form an adaptive system. The system is evaluated by validating the results generated for various case studies using a validation tool. The expected behaviour is that the resulting course agenda agrees with the learning mode preference of the user provided initially and the results are expected to change according to the changing user preferences through a self-assessment questionnaire.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100057","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000121","","","Multi-agent system, Virtual learning environment, Online education, Simulation, Learning management systems","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Graph-based cognitive diagnosis for intelligent tutoring systems","Yu Su and Zeyu Cheng and Jinze Wu and Yanmin Dong and Zhenya Huang and Le Wu and Enhong Chen and Shijin Wang and Fei Xie","Knowledge-Based Systems","2022","ScienceDirect","109547","253","For intelligent tutoring systems, Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) is a fundamental task that aims to estimate the mastery degree of a student on each skill according to the exercise record. The CD task is considered rather challenging since we need to model inner-relations and inter-relations among students, skills, and questions to obtain more abundant information. Most existing methods attempt to solve this problem through two-way interactions between students and questions (or between students and skills), ignoring potential high-order relations among entities. Furthermore, how to construct an end-to-end framework that can model the complex interactions among different types of entities at the same time remains unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (GCDM) that directly discovers the interactions among students, skills, and questions through a heterogeneous cognitive graph. Specifically, we design two graph-based layers: a performance-relative propagator and an attentive knowledge aggregator. The former is applied to propagate a student’s cognitive state through different types of graph edges, while the latter selectively gathers messages from neighboring graph nodes. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness and extendibility of our proposed model.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109547","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095070512200778X","","","Cognitive diagnosis, Graph neural networks, Interpretable machine learning","","0950-7051","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

They may be difficult for educators to design and implement; only provide discrete snapshots of performance rather than nuanced views of learning; be unadapted to the particular knowledge, skills, and backgrounds of participants; be tailored to the culture of schooling rather than the cultures schooling is designed to prepare students to enter; and assess skills that humans routinely use computers to perform. We review extant artificial intelligence approaches that–at least partially–address these issues and critically discuss whether these approaches present additional challenges for assessment practice.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100075","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000303","","","","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Improving online education through automatic learning style identification using a multi-step architecture with ant colony system and artificial neural networks","Jason Bernard and Elvira Popescu and Sabine Graf","Applied Soft Computing","2022","ScienceDirect","109779","131","Learning style is one of the individual differences which play an important role in learning. Being aware of it helps the student to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and the teacher to provide more valuable personalized interventions. Furthermore, learning style-based adaptive educational systems can be designed, which have been shown to increase student satisfaction or learning gain, while reducing the time needed to learn. It is therefore important to have an accurate method for identifying students’ learning styles. Since the traditional approach of filling in dedicated psychological questionnaires has several disadvantages, automatic methods have been proposed, based on investigating student observable behavior in a learning environment. Research done so far generally takes a mono-algorithmic approach to identify learning styles, and the precision rates leave room for improvement. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid multi-step architecture based on ant colony system and artificial neural networks to increase the precision of learning styles identification. Two different variants are proposed and evaluated with data from 75 students; results show high precision values, outperforming existing automatic approaches for learning style identification. The proposed architecture can be integrated into widely used educational systems (e.g., learning management systems) to provide learners and/or teachers with information about students’ learning styles. In addition, it can be integrated into adaptive educational systems and plugins of learning management systems to automatically identify learning styles and personalize instruction respectively.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109779","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494622008286","","","Hybrid intelligent systems, Learning styles, Learner model, Learning management systems, Ant colony systems, Artificial neural networks","","1568-4946","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

There are increasing interests as well as many challenges in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in educational settings to provide adaptive learning content to learners. Knowledge assessment is necessary for providing an adaptive learning environment. A student model serves as a fundamental building block of knowledge assessment in an adaptive learning environment. This paper intends to review the development of dominant families of student models with psychometric theory in early educational research, recent adaptations, and advances with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our review covers not only the important families of student models but also why they were invented from both theoretical and practical viewpoints with AI and educational perspectives. We believe that the discussion covered in this review will be a valuable reference of introductory insights to AI for educational researchers, as well as an endeavor of introducing basic psychometric perspectives to AI experts for knowledge assessment in the field of learning science.

It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100066","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000212","","","Student dropout prediction, Agents of education, Learning analytics, Artificial intelligence, Educational data mining","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

This study conducts a bibliometric analysis that included 383 key articles published between 1992 and 2021 to review the evolutionary nuances of knowledge tracing research. Besides, we employ document clustering to uncover the most common topics of knowledge tracing and systematically review each topic's characteristics. Major findings include broad knowledge tracing trends information such as the most productive authors, the most referenced articles, and the occurrence of author keywords. Existing knowledge tracing models are further divided into three clusters: Markov process-based knowledge tracing, logistic knowledge tracing, and deep learning-based knowledge tracing. The attributes of each cluster were then discussed, as well as recent development and application.

It is reported that such problems can be eliminated by making the new generation intelligent learning systems. However, there is still an ongoing search for making such systems intelligent and a conceptual discussion concerning them. Integrating an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with learning analytics, this study seeks to design and present the framework of an ITS with open access that a) identifies the learning needs of learners through adaptive mastery testing and guides learners based on these needs, b) overcomes learning deficiencies, monitors learners' interactions with content through learning analytics and offers suggestions, c) supports learning with dynamic assessment processes and d) tests learners’ learning competencies.

McIntyre","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2022","ScienceDirect","100106","3","Cumulative experience is important for developing expertise through in-person learning, along with country setting and gender, but evidence is limited the role of these features in online learning. Yet, COVID-19 has catalysed the centrality of online learning, such that the efficacy of online learning is now highly relevant. Although the Pandemic triggered a surge of self-report and literature review research on stakeholder perceptions of online learning, less educational research has used big data to understand online learning. Therefore, the present research mined online learning data to identify features that are important for developing expertise in online learning. Data mining of 54,842,787 initial data points from one online learning platform was conducted by partnering theory with data in model development. Following examination of a theory-led machine learning model, a data-led approach was taken to reach a final model. The linear regression model was regularised with the Lasso penalty to enable data-driven feature selection. Twenty-six features were selected to form an extreme gradient boosting model that underwent hyper-parameter tuning. All cross-validation adopted the grid search approach. The final model was used to derive Shapley values for feature importance. As expected, cumulative experience, country differences, low-and-middle-income country status, and COVID-19 were important features for developing expertise through online learning. The data-led model development resulted in additional insights not examined in the initial, theory-led model: namely, the importance of meta-cognition and independent learner behaviour. Surprisingly, no male advantage was found in the potential for expertise development through online learning.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100106","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000613","","","Machine learning, Online learning, COVID-19, Country comparison, Developing expertise","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"Review on A big data-based innovative knowledge teaching evaluation system in universities","Xu Xin and Yu Shu-Jiang and Pang Nan and Dou ChenXu and Li Dan","Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","2022","ScienceDirect","100197","7","With the widespread use of digital technologies such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence in higher education, how to establish a scientific and systematic evaluation system to turn the traditional classroom with the one-way transmission of knowledge into an interactive space for exchanging ideas and inspiring wisdom has become an essential task for human resource management in universities, and a key to improving teaching quality. However, due to the debate between scientism and humanism in teaching evaluation, studies related to teaching performance have been isolated from human resource management, resulting in the lack of a systematic vision and framework for such studies. Relevant studies are still limited to the evaluation contents of different evaluation subjects. Evaluations also tend to focus only on the teaching process, ignoring the objectives of talent training, making it difficult for evaluations to play a goal-oriented role and hindering the further development of relevant studies. Therefore, this paper draws on human resource management methodologies and analyzes knowledge teaching evaluation system characteristics in colleges and universities in a big data context to construct a “multiple evaluations, trinity and four-step closed-loop” big data-based knowledge teaching evaluation system. “Trinity” represents evaluation from three performance dimensions: teaching effect, teaching behavior and teaching ability. “Multiple evaluations” represents the design of teaching performance indicators based on teaching data, breaking the barriers between different evaluation subjects. “Four-step closed-loop” draws on performance management theory to standardize the teaching performance management process from four aspects: planning, implementation, evaluation, and feedback. This evaluation system provides a systematic methodology for unifying the theory and practice of innovative knowledge teaching evaluation system in universities in a big data context.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jik.2022.100197","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X22000373","","","Big data, Knowledge teaching evaluation, Performance management","","2444-569X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Is it a good move? Mining effective tutoring strategies from human–human tutorial dialogues","Jionghao Lin and Shaveen Singh and Lele Sha and Wei Tan and David Lang and Dragan Gašević and Guanliang Chen","Future Generation Computer Systems","2022","ScienceDirect","194-207","127","To construct dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) with sufficient pedagogical expertise, a trendy research method is to mine large-scale data collected by existing dialogue-based ITS or generated between human tutors and students to discover effective tutoring strategies. However, most of the existing research has mainly focused on the analysis of successful tutorial dialogue. We argue that, to better inform the design of dialogue-based ITS, it is also important to analyse unsuccessful tutorial dialogues and gain a better understanding of the reasons behind those failures. Therefore, our study aimed to identify effective tutoring strategies by mining a large-scale dataset of both successful and unsuccessful human–human online tutorial dialogues, and further used these tutoring strategies for predicting students’ problem-solving performance. Specifically, the study adopted a widely-used educational dialogue act scheme to describe the action behind utterances made by a tutor/student in the broader context of a tutorial dialogue (e.g., asking/answering a question, providing hints). Frequent dialogue acts were identified and analysed by taking into account the prior progress that a student had made before the start of a tutorial session and the problem-solving performance the student achieved after the end of the session. Besides, we performed a sequence analysis on the inferred actions to identify prominent patterns that were closely related to students’ problem-solving performance. These prominent patterns could shed light on the frequent strategies used by tutors. Lastly, we measured the power of these tutorial actions in predicting students’ problem-solving performance by applying a well-established machine learning method, Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB). Through extensive analysis and evaluations, we identified a set of different action patterns that were pertinent to tutors and students across dialogues of different traits, e.g., students without prior progress in solving problems, compared to those with prior progress, were likely to receive more thought-provoking questions from their tutors. More importantly, we demonstrated that the actions taken by students and tutors during a tutorial process could not adequately predict student performance and should be considered together with other relevant factors (e.g., the informativeness of the utterances).","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.09.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X21003393","","","Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Educational dialogue analysis, Tutoring strategies, Dialogue acts, Student performance, Learning analytics","","0167-739X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Chapter Three - Machine learning for short reach optical fiber systems","Boris Karanov and Polina Bayvel and Laurent Schmalen","","2022","ScienceDirect","65-89","","Short reach optical fiber communications rely on the intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) technology to enable simple and inexpensive solutions in many data center, metro and access network scenarios. The IM/DD links are severely impaired by fiber dispersion as well as non-linearity and noise stemming from the low-cost transmitter and receiver hardware components. Thus, digital signal processing (DSP) is required for increasing the data rate and transmission reach of such systems. However, there is a lack of optimal, computationally feasible DSP algorithms for communication over the dispersive non-linear IM/DD channel. This necessitates the use of carefully chosen approximations to better exploit the data transmission potential over the optical links. The chapter discusses the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning in the design and optimization of DSP modules for short reach optical IM/DD communication systems. In addition to the design of a deep learning-based receiver for conventional pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) transmission, the focus is on the implementation of fully learnable ANN transceivers, also known as auto-encoders.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-32-385227-2.00010-3","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323852272000103","","","Digital signal processing, Modulation, Detection, Deep learning, Feed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Generative adversarial networks, Auto-encoder","Academic Press","","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

Unfortunately, many schools lack a sense of social responsibility when applying digital education. Students are online more than ever before. There are the potential for increased exposure to risks such as exposure to harmful content, cyberbullying, age-inappropriate advertising and data misuse, which affect students’ well-being and undermine their right to privacy. Schools should bear the overall social moral level of social responsibility. This paper focuses on the social responsibility of schools under the new crown epidemic and holds that implanting social responsibility into the value system of the current digital education reform, which can promote the sustainable development of education. This is also a relatively neglected problem in the practice of educational reform. European standard: ISO26000 is adopted as a CEN-standard. 21 October 2020 the stakeholder consultation process in the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) decided that ISO 26000 is approved as a CEN-standard. For businesses and organizations committed to operating in a socially responsible way, there’s ISO 26000. It provides guidance to those who recognize that respect for society and environment is a critical success factor. This paper highlights the school how to take social responsibility by using ISO 26000. Based on the seven subjects of ISO 26000, this paper constructs the social responsibility of digital education frame, focuses on analyzing the main content and core issues of social responsibility of digital education, puts forward some improved strategies and suggestions for the more prominent problems at this stage through the examination and reflection of reality.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asej.2021.10.025","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447921003932","","","ISO 26000, Social responsibility, Artificial intelligence, Digital education, ISO 45003","","2090-4479","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Chapter 16 - Evaluate learner level assessment in intelligent e-learning systems using probabilistic network model","Rohit B. Kaliwal and Santosh L. Deshpande","","2022","ScienceDirect","255-265","","E-learning is a broader term than “m-learning” and “online learning.” The originality is that it provides the learner with the chance to learn anywhere and anytime. As technology is improving, teaching-learning methodologies are also changing by making electronic learning one of the leading trends in the education system. Due to the complexity of the education system, the prospective dynamics of e-learning require the development of a knowledge delivery and evaluation system. In the history of the education system, a pandemic situation created major disruption affecting 1.6 billion learners in 190 countries all over the globe. In this chapter, an evaluation method for assessing the learner assessment in an intelligent e-learning system is presented. Our method is called the probabilistic network (PN) model and is a well-known evaluation method for the learners in a framework. However, evaluation of the learner’s learning and outcomes still remains a challenge. The main objective of this chapter is to add its dimension toward the evaluation of learning outcomes especially for the learners of intelligent e-learning systems. In this case, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) were the bone for the smooth running of teaching and have been playing an important role in the e-learning system. An ITS is a type of knowledge-based system whose main objective is to effectively complement a human tutor with a computer. Unlike conventional classroom teaching, ITSs have the potential to fit according to an individual learner’s needs. A probability-based ITS structure is suggested in this chapter, consisting of four models, specifically the learner’s action model, the pedagogical model, the knowledge base model, and the learner assessment model. The importance is being given to test the learner level model where an element of complexity has been introduced and handled by the probabilistic network or Bayesian network model. The purpose of this assessment learner model is to correctly determine the level of knowledge of each learner based on their response to the level of questions, where the level of questions is random to the evaluation process of the learner. With the aid of Bayes’ law, the method has integrated into it the complexity and has found positive results that take the possibility of learners into account.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-824054-0.00029-0","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128240540000290","","","Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), Intelligent e-learning systems, Bayesian network (BN), E-learning, Learner","Academic Press","","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

The findings of this study have made substantial contributions to the progress of online education, which is especially relevant in light of the current global pandemic. As a result of the current expansion of deep learning methods over the last decade, researchers have been tempted to include deep learning strategies into KT research with astounding results. In this paper, we evaluate current research on deep learning-based KT in the main categories listed below. In particular, we explore (1) a granular categorisation of the technological solutions presented by the mainstream Deep Learning-based KT Models.

Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) has progressed as an emerging area of research corresponding to recent advances in mobile technologies and the proliferation of smartphones and tablet computers. Accordingly, this study examined MALL research between 2008 and 2020 through a bibliometric analysis using social network analysis (SNA) and text mining techniques. The SNA and text mining analysis suggest five broad research themes: (1) self-regulated language learning by defining one's own learning objectives, (2) providing learner agency and motivation by empowering autonomy, (3) personalizing learning through artificial intelligence (AI)-supported mobile learning (m-learning), (4) MALL for learning in the wild, and (5) MALL to support higher education. The findings show that while MALL research has been considerably operationalized around linguistic factors, nonlinguistic factors relating to learners' interactions with mobile devices or applications have been largely overlooked. It was found that MALL scholarship has recently tended to incorporate the use of mobile devices in informal learning contexts and outside the classroom due to the flexibility and anytime anywhere functionality of m-learning. The study concludes with several suggestions and highlights the areas that need more attention in MALL research.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2022.102925","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X2200207X","","","Bibliometric analysis, Informal learning, Mobile-assisted language learning, Mobile learning, Smartphones","","0346-251X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

Students in music education research and develop new methods for teaching and learning music. Through peer-reviewed publications and instruction at the University of Music for music teachers, students in the field of music conduct their research. Using artificial intelligence in the classroom is a challenge because music is an available domain that requires students and teachers to innovate and solve problems. In this paper, Music Education and Teaching based on AI (MET-AI) techniques are increasingly comprehensive with modern science and technology, enhancing music education. The use of artificial intelligence in music education breached the conventional paradigm of music education, particularly electronic music and innovative music software in private colleges, which has significantly enhanced the standard of teaching music and the teaching model for music education. The experimental results show us that the network teaching platform Music Major should be continuously improved based on artificial intelligence technologies. AI can make more optimized environments and professional music classes so that teachers and students can make the most of this and ensure smooth improvement in the network's teaching model. The MET-AI scores students’ learning outcome rate of 95.2%, an efficiency ratio of 98.1%, the mean square error rate of 17.9%, accuracy ratio of 95.3%, teaching performance analysis ratio of 90.7%, the false-positive rate of 18.6%, true positive rate 95.7% and flexibility ratio of 92,1%.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2022.107851","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790622001434","","","Music education, Artificial intelligence, Network Teaching, Student, Teacher","","0045-7906","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"GRL-LS: A learning style detection in online education using graph representation learning","Bello {Ahmad Muhammad} and Chao Qi and Zhenqiang Wu and Hafsa {Kabir Ahmad}","Expert Systems with Applications","2022","ScienceDirect","117138","201","The accessibility and popularity of online learning have aided the spread of modern learning systems, which provide numerous opportunities for studying the behavior of learners and improving their learning quality. In online platforms, different learners have different learning styles based on their learning behavior. As a result, analyzing learners’ behavior and detecting their learning styles is important in order to provide appropriate resource recommendations, thereby improving their learning outcomes. While several approaches for detecting learning styles have been suggested, behavioral data is collected on a large scale, making it difficult to capture learners’ behavior efficiently. Furthermore, current approaches neglect relationships between learner-resource interaction and use techniques based on individual learners’ features. However, considering these relations can provide additional benefits. Motivated by these limitations, we propose GRL-LS, a learning style detection approach based on graph representation learning techniques. We first construct a bipartite graph representing the interaction between the set of learners and the set of learning resources. We then introduce a graph embedding technique that learns the latent representations of learners and resources. The learned representation is mapped with the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) to identify and group learners using K-means algorithms. The GRL-LS technique can be used in a wide range of educational settings and can be customized to fit a variety of learning style models. An experiment on real-world KDDCup datasets was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GRL-LS approach. The results show that the proposed GRL-LS is efficient at detecting learning style, performs best for all FSLSM dimensions with average accuracy and precision of 88.25% and 78.50% respectively, and outperforms existing approaches with an average improvement of 8.55% accuracy and 2.33% precision.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117138","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005346","","","Graph learning, Graph autoencoder, Learning style, Interactive learning environment, Learners behavior","","0957-4174","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Enhancing argumentative writing with automated feedback and social comparison nudging","Thiemo Wambsganss and Andreas Janson and Jan Marco Leimeister","Computers & Education","2022","ScienceDirect","104644","191","The advantages offered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning enable students to receive automated feedback on their argumentation skills, independent of educator, time, and location. Although there is a growing amount of literature on formative argumentation feedback, empirical evidence on the effects of adaptive feedback mechanisms and novel NLP approaches to enhance argumentative writing remains scarce. To help fill this gap, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether automated feedback and social comparison nudging enable students to internalize and improve logical argumentation writing abilities in an undergraduate business course. We conducted a mixed-methods study to investigate the impact of argumentative writing on 71 students in a field experiment. Students in treatment group 1 completed their assignment while receiving automated feedback, whereas students in treatment group 2 completed the same assignment while receiving automated feedback with a social comparison nudge that indicated how other students performed on the same assignment. Students in the control group received generalized feedback based on rules of syntax. We found that participants who received automated argumentation feedback with a social comparison nudge wrote more convincing texts with higher-quality argumentation compared to the two benchmark groups (p < 0.05). The measured self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and qualitative data provide valuable insights that help explain this effect. The results suggest that embedding automated feedback in combination with social comparison nudges enables students to increase their argumentative writing skills by triggering psychological processes. Receiving only automated feedback in the form of in-text argumentative highlighting without any further guidance appears not to significantly influence students’ writing abilities when compared to syntactic feedback.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104644","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131522002159","","","Argumentation, Automated feedback, Social comparison nudging, Natural language processing, Machine learning","","0360-1315","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

Solving TDF problems encounters challenges in understanding diagrams, representing the functions of being compound objects, and solving the mixture group of functions and universal relations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a relation-centric algorithm, leveraging on making breakthrough in handling function, understanding diagram, and generating tutorable solution. The proposed algorithm comprises two phases: problem understanding and symbolic solver. In the problem understanding, it proposes a S2P (Syntax Semantics with Period) model method of acquiring relations from text and a L2 (Line Segment with Labels Pattern) model method of acquiring relations from diagrams. To get the problem fully understood, this phase acquires both universal relations and period relations. In the symbolic solver, the function is first built from the acquired relations. Then an equation-function interaction method is created to solve a mixture system of relations and functions. The developed algorithm is the first one for solving text-diagram function problems. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has high accuracies of 74.5% on Math23KtoF and 80.8% on TnD1K datasets, but also can produce the tutorable solutions of TDF problems.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2022.08.023","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S131915782200297X","","","Relation-centric algorithm, Symbolic solver, Syntax semantics model with period, Diagram understanding","","1319-1578","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

While Coursera, edX, Udacity, and FutureLearn received most of the attention and scrutiny, an entirely new ecosystem of local MOOC providers was growing in parallel. This ecosystem is harder to study than the major players: they are spread around the world, have less staff devoted to maintaining research data, and operate in multiple languages with university and corporate regional partners. To better understand how online learning opportunities are expanding through this regional MOOC ecosystem, we created a research partnership among 15 different MOOC providers from nine countries. We gathered data from over eight million learners in six thousand MOOCs, and we conducted a large-scale survey with more than 10 thousand participants. From our analysis, we argue that these regional providers may be better positioned to meet the goals of expanding access to higher education in their regions than the better-known global providers. To make this claim we highlight three trends: first, regional providers attract a larger local population with more inclusive demographic profiles; second, students predominantly choose their courses based on topical interest, and regional providers do a better job at catering to those needs; and third, many students feel more at ease learning from institutions they already know and have references from.

Accordingly, these dramatic changes call for novel traffic management solutions to adequately countermeasure such unexpected and massive changes in traffic characteristics. In this paper, we focus on communication and collaboration apps whose traffic experienced a sudden growth during the last two years. Specifically, we consider nine apps whose traffic we collect, reliably label, and publicly release as a new dataset (MIRAGE-COVID-CCMA-2022) to the scientific community. First, we investigate the capability of state-of-art single-modal and multimodal Deep Learning-based classifiers in telling the specific app, the activity performed by the user, or both. While we highlight that state-of-art solutions reports a more-than-satisfactory performance in addressing app classification (96%–98% F-measure), evident shortcomings stem out when tackling activity classification (56%–65% F-measure) when using approaches that leverage the transport-layer payload and/or per-packet information attainable from the initial part of the biflows. In line with these limitations, we design a novel set of inputs (namely Context Inputs) providing clues about the nature of a biflow by observing the biflows coexisting simultaneously. Based on these considerations, we propose Mimetic-All a novel early traffic classification multimodal solution that leverages Context Inputs as an additional modality, achieving ≥82% F-measure in activity classification. Also, capitalizing the multimodal nature of Mimetic-All, we evaluate different combinations of the inputs. Interestingly, experimental results witness that Mimetic-ConSeq—a variant that uses the Context Inputs but does not rely on payload information (thus gaining greater robustness to more opaque encryption sub-layers possibly going to be adopted in the future)—experiences only ≈1% F-measure drop in performance w.r.t.

However, in several cases, generic controls have proven to have limited effects on the protection of children’s privacy, raising questions about the need to further develop children- specific technical controls. This paper contributes to address the need for privacy controls by providing (a) a summary of real-world applications of information technologies domains that expose children to privacy risks, and (b) a list that represents the state-of-the-art of the technical controls designed specifically to protect children’s privacy. We identify 24 technical controls that we manually classify with NIST Security and Privacy control categories and Hoepman’s Privacy design strategies.

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102542","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401222000767","","","Avatars, Augmented reality, Extended reality, Metaverse, Second life, Virtual reality, Virtual world","","0268-4012","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"An Analysis Model of Learners’ Online Learning Status Based on Deep Neural Network and Multi-Dimensional Information Fusion","Mingyong Li and Lirong Tang and Longfei Ma and Honggang Zhao and Jinyu Hu and Yan Wei","CMES - Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences","2022","ScienceDirect","2349-2371","135","The learning status of learners directly affects the quality of learning. Compared with offline teachers, it is difficult for online teachers to capture the learning status of students in the whole class, and it is even more difficult to continue to pay attention to students while teaching. Therefore, this paper proposes an online learning state analysis model based on a convolutional neural network and multi-dimensional information fusion. Specifically, a facial expression recognition model and an eye state recognition model are constructed to detect students’ emotions and fatigue, respectively. By integrating the detected data with the homework test score data after online learning, an analysis model of students’ online learning status is constructed. According to the PAD model, the learning state is expressed as three dimensions of students’ understanding, engagement and interest, and then analyzed from multiple perspectives. Finally, the proposed model is applied to actual teaching, and procedural analysis of 5 different types of online classroom learners is carried out, and the validity of the model is verified by comparing with the results of the manual analysis.","","https://doi.org/10.32604/cmes.2023.022604","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526149222002430","","","Deep learning, fatigue detection, facial expression recognition, sentiment analysis, information fusion","","1526-1492","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"31 - COVID-19: will it be a game changer in higher education in India?","Anal Acharya and Soumen Mukherjee and Arup Kumar Bhattacharjee and Debabrata Datta and Arpan Deyasi","","2022","ScienceDirect","611-629","","The aim of this chapter is to compare the efficacy of various forms of education that may be imparted to students in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the consequent lockdown period where traditional modes of education are suspended. Various colleges and universities where the authors are currently teaching have been instructed to teach in online mode using tools like zoom messenger. In this direction, the authors first discuss how outcome-based online learning may be implemented in the Indian education sector. To prove their point, the authors select a set of students from the science and engineering streams and impart education to them using both traditional and online methods. Tests are conducted on them after both forms of learning. Multivariate regression analysis is applied on these test results to derive a model for both forms of learning. Results show that both forms of learning are equally effective on these classes of students. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for the simulation purpose. Thus we may conclude that in normal circumstances the online method of teaching may not always be beneficial considering the stages and adaptability among all sections of students in a variety of disciplines, but for the science and engineering discipline, a blended learning composed of both classroom-based teaching and online learning methodology may be used to obtain good results, especially when the former form of learning is not available.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-90769-9.00034-7","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323907699000347","","","COVID-19, Higher education in India, Multivariate regression, Online learning","Academic Press","","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Bi-CLKT: Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing","Xiangyu Song and Jianxin Li and Qi Lei and Wei Zhao and Yunliang Chen and Ajmal Mian","Knowledge-Based Systems","2022","ScienceDirect","108274","241","The goal of Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to estimate how well students have mastered a concept based on their historical learning of related exercises. The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students’ learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; (2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and (3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer comparative learning scheme based on an “exercise-to-exercise” (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108274","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705122000880","","","Contrastive learning, Self-supervised learning, Deep knowledge tracing, Graph neural network, Intelligent tutoring systems","","0950-7051","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Digital Twins are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries to manage complex systems. As digital twins become more sophisticated, there is an increased need for effective training and learning systems. Teachers, project leaders, and tool vendors encounter challenges while teaching and training their students, co-workers, and users.
Methods
In this study, we propose a new method for training users in using digital twins by proposing a gamified and virtual environment. We present an overall architecture and discuss its practical realization.
Results
We propose a set of future challenges that we consider critical to enabling a more effective learning/training approach.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vrih.2022.08.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096579622000675","","","Digital twins, Virtual reality, Gamification, Learning, Training","","2096-5796","","Virtual-reality and intelligent hardware in digital twins B)","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

The learning process is essentially the pairwise interactions of Students, Concepts, and Questions (S–C, S–Q, C–Q for short). Modeling all these interactions will improve the performance of KT. However, existing KT methods hardly exploit all the interactions in a single model. Specifically, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and most of its variants neglect C–Q; Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and other deep neural network approaches mostly neglect S–Q and C–Q. We propose the Ensemble Knowledge Tracing (EnKT), which models all three types of interactions. The base model of EnKT is a hybrid of BKT and DKT. We also present an ensemble algorithm Recurrent Boosting (RB), which extends AdaBoost to deal with KT sequential data. Inspired by BKT, EnKT represents S–C and S–Q using learning and performance parameters, respectively. Besides, EnKT defines C–Q as the correlation complexity among the concepts involved in a question. Experiments show EnKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (by up to 6% in AUC in some cases) on four real-world benchmark datasets and illustrate better interpretability by several typical case studies.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117680","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422009769","","","Knowledge Tracing, Deep neural network, Learning interactions, User modeling","","0957-4174","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"A 2-tier fuzzy control system for grade adjustment based on students’ social interactions","Akrivi Krouska and Christos Troussas and Athanasios Voulodimos and Cleo Sgouropoulou","Expert Systems with Applications","2022","ScienceDirect","117503","203","The advent of social networking platforms has opened new horizons in the field of digital education. The research effort in this field is still in its infancy and many aspects remain unexplored. For instance, in traditional classrooms, tutors compute students’ final grade based on several external factors, such as their effort, participation, etc. However, according to the related literature, e-learning systems do not sufficiently follow this rationale providing solely the average score of the chapters’ tests. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a two-tier fuzzy controller for recommending a readjustment of the students’ final grade based on their social interactions. More specifically, the first tier of the module dynamically diagnoses the degree of students’ participation, while the second tier offers a recommendation for adjustment of the students’ grade. In this way, the grading is more accurate and fairer, reflecting the overall student performance throughout the learning process. Our approach was evaluated from several perspectives to ensure the effective use of the system and its positive impact on learners. The findings reveal that this novel module provides a more precise and rightful grading system, promoting student engagement.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117503","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422008326","","","Adjusted student grading, E-learning, Fuzzy logic, Social Networks","","0957-4174","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

The theories of learning have changed in recent decades, and new technologies have been invented that provide possibilities for supporting learning processes based on different learning theories. Recently, this field has been studied using bibliometric methods with large datasets to gain an overview of this research area. This paper continues this approach by targeting and analyzing the most relevant journals in the field, covering 30,632 articles. The aim was to deepen the results gained from previous bibliometric studies by focusing on the journals within the educational technology field, the keywords used, the most-cited papers, and especially by outlining the theoretical backgrounds of the analyzed articles. Results show new journals with increasing numbers of articles published. By analyzing the publications used as the articles' backgrounds, we can identify the large entities within the field. Articles targeted how technology can support learning processes based on different learning theories. Along with building an understanding of technology-related learning processes, the second large area of research targets the integration and factors affecting the use of technology for teaching and learning practices. The third large perspective focuses on learners’ characteristics, especially their learning skills, motivation, and self-efficacy.

However, the focus of the debate has been mostly on game studies and human-computer interaction (HCI). Even though games are increasingly being supplied as services to customers, few academic works have linked game studies to the service or marketing literature (Dikcius and Urbonavicius, 2020; Dukembay and Zhaksylyk, 2019). This paper presents an examination of the emerging trends of gamification and e-learning for young learners. The first section presents a text-based cluster bibliometric analysis based on 222 qualified articles published between 2015 and 2020. We conducted this analysis to identify the most prominent themes in the literature through cluster identification via the VOS viewer software. As the themes were found to be interlinked, the second section presents a systematic literature review based on a bibliometric analysis performed using the PRISMA method on 32 qualified articles. The findings highlighted the four major future research themes of personalization, game elements, learner styles, and learner engagement. Finally, we provide a future research agenda based on the theory, characteristics, context, and methodology (TCCM) framework.

The number of people learning through Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other online resources has been increasing rapidly because they provide us with the flexibility to learn from anywhere at any time. This provides a good learning experience for the students. However, such learning interface requires the ability to recognize the level of engagement of the students for a holistic learning experience. This is useful for both students and educators alike. However, understanding engagement is a challenging task, because of its subjectivity and ability to collect data. In this paper, we propose a variety of models that have been trained on an open-source dataset of video screengrabs. Our non-deep learning models are based on the combination of popular algorithms such as Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF). The deep learning methods include Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet-121), Residual Network (ResNet-18) and MobileNetV1. We show the performance of each models using a variety of metrics such as the Gini Index, Adjusted F-Measure (AGF), and Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We use various dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to understand the distribution of data in the feature sub-space. Our work will thereby assist the educators and students in obtaining a fruitful and efficient online learning experience.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sasc.2022.200039","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772941922000059","","","engagement, facial expression recognition, deep learning, convolutional neural network, histogram of oriented gradient, support vector machine","","2772-9419","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

This paper concerns the efficient method to improve the safety of the agent during the exploration stage in q-learning without any prior knowledge. We propose a novel approach named safe exploration mask to reduce the number of safety violations in q-learning by modifying the transition possibility of the environment. To this end, a safety indicator function consisting of distance metric and controllability metric is designed. The safety indicator function can be learned by the agent through bootstrapping without additional optimization solver. We prove that the safety indicator function will converge in tabular q-learning and introduce two tricks to mitigate the divergence in approximation-based q-learning. Based on the safety indicator function, the safe exploration mask is generated to modify the original exploration policy by reducing the transition possibility of unsafe actions. Finally, the simulations in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate the advantages, feasibility, and safety of our method in both discrete and continuous q-learning algorithms.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.104765","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197622000574","","","Reinforcement learning, Safe exploration, Fuzzy Q-learning, Safe reinforcement learning","","0952-1976","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

While most of the literature has focused on students and the learning opportunities that are offered to them, the teachers behind the recommended courses get a certain exposure when they appear in the final ranking. Underexposed teachers might have reduced opportunities to offer their services, so accounting for this perspective is of central importance to generate equity in the recommendation process. In this paper, we consider groups of teachers based on their geographic provenience and assess provider (un)fairness based on the continent they belong to. We consider measures of visibility and exposure, to account (i) in how many recommendations and (ii) wherein the ranking of the teachers belonging to different groups appear. We observe disparities that favor the most represented groups, and we overcome these phenomena with a re-ranking approach that provides each group with the expected visibility and exposure, thus controlling fairness of providers coming from different continents (cross-continent provider fairness). Experiments performed on data coming from a real-world MOOC platform show that our approach can provide fairness without affecting recommendation effectiveness.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.08.025","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X21003332","","","Educational recommender systems, Provider fairness, Geographic groups","","0167-739X","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

With an unprecedented number of learners engaging with online modes of education, there is a growing need to understand the underlying student enrolment motivations, goals and learning behaviours evolving from a highly diverse student population. Research in learning analytics has advanced the use of digital data to understand student learning processes. However, there remains a limited understanding of how non-traditional learner characteristics, needs and motivational factors influence their learning behaviour and engagement strategies. Survey data from 232 students enrolled in fully online degree programs at a large public research university in Australia has been examined and used to represent 1687 students that have not completed the survey. To characterise the larger population of students, we combined their demographics, digital trace data, and course performance to provide richer insights of non-traditional learners in online learning. Data science approaches are applied, including an unsupervised machine learning technique that revealed the results of six unique learner profiles, clearly differentiated by their motivation, demographic, engagement and performance. While the findings show that each learner profile faces unique study challenges, there are also unique opportunities associated with each profile that could be utilised to improve their learning outcomes. The practical implications of the study on teaching practices are further discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100051","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000066","","","Online learning, Student profiling, Non-traditional learners, Motivation, Enrolment, Unsupervised learning","","2666-920X","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

"Considering Intelligent Tutoring Systems as Mass Customization of Digital Education","Gembarski, Paul Christoph and Hoppe, Lukas","Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering","2022","Engineering Village","935 - 942","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In the digital era, individualized educational services, e.g. distributed by intelligent tutoring systems, are becoming increasingly popular and important for life-long learning but also during the COVID pandemic as many universities had to switch to distance learning immediately. Intelligent tutoring systems simulate behavior and expertise of physical teachers and support learners individually. In addition to closed questions, which can be modeled simply as if-then statements or decision trees, the use of artificial intelligence enables more and more the implementation of open questions and poorly structured problems, which is of particular importance for e.g. engineering education. In order to make the learning experience authentic, it is important to understand the learners as individuals and to confront them with learning content and in-depth knowledge tailored to their needs and skills. If, e.g., a formative assessment shows that a certain content has not yet been internalized, the tutoring system must detect this and react accordingly. Since this largely corresponds to mass customizing the teaching process, the following article frames digital education with focus on intelligent tutoring systems in context with mass customization. For cracking the code of mass customizing digital education, the three mass customization key competences solution space development, robust process design as well as choice navigation are taken as reference to set up digital educational content.<br/></div> © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90700-6_107","","","","","21954356","English","","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Each student seeks an environment that is suitable for his needs, with personalized and adaptable content that allows him to have a more successful and meaningful learning experience. Learner profile is a structure comprising direct and indirect information of learner’s background, objectives, interest and preferences. Taking a leaner’s profile into account while designing courses is beneficial, and profile modeling is an essential method that seeks to provide a comprehensive representation of all factors linked to the user's attributes. In this paper we propose a machine learning model for predicting learner profile. It serves as a basis to a suitable user-centered adaptation of gamification and content. The potential of our model is considering both the player and learner contexts by integrating learners’ interactions, preferences, troubles and cognitive capacities. We tested the efficiency of our contribution in a gamified learning environment called ""Class Quiz"".

However, we do need to consider whether such technology will support student learning or make learning more difficult. In the absence of a mature conversational Intelligent Tutoring System, this article aims to address this question indirectly through an investigation of how students and tutors in an online learning programme perceive the concept of conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems, such as a chatbot, for online learning. This is achieved by surveying students who are currently enrolled in an online programme and interviewing the tutors on the same programme. The research concludes that ITS would very likely enhance online learning experience for both students and tutors, but there are various concerns that must be addressed.<br/></div> © 2022 IEEE.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766567","","","Computer aided instruction;Education computing;Engineering education;Online systems;Artificial intelligence;Learning systems;E-learning;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;","","21659559","English","Chatbots;E - learning;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning context;Learning projects;Online learning;Student learning;Technology enhanced learning;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"
"Knowledge tracing: A survey","Abdelrahman, Ghodai and Wang, Qing and Nunes, Bernardo Pereira","arXiv","2022","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Humans' ability to transfer knowledge through teaching is one of the essential aspects for human intelligence. A human teacher can track the knowledge of students to customize the teaching on students' needs. With the rise of online education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials' recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review for the KT literature. We cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets. Besides these, we shed light on key modelling differences between closely related methods and summarize them in an easy-to-understand format. Finally, we discuss current research gaps in the KT literature and possible future research and application directions.<br/></div> © 2022, CC BY.","","","","","","Bayesian networks;Computer aided instruction;Curricula;Deep learning;Education computing;Intelligent agents;Students;Teaching;","","23318422","English","Bayesian knowledge tracing;Bayesian knowledge tracings;Deep learning;Intelligent educations;Key values;Key-value memory;Knowledge tracings;Learning experiences;Memory network;Sequence models;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Confucius institutes went online and now follow 2021 to 2025 Action Plans for the Construction of Teaching Resources for International Chinese Education and International Chinese Online Education. New ways of learning Chinese emerged, such as educational games and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), some of them based on artificial intelligence. The aim of this systematic review is to examine recent (from 2017 to 2022) research published in ScienceDirect and Scopus databases on the use and impact of educational games and ITS in Chinese language learning. A total of 29 selected studies were analysed. Based on the overall findings, games and ITS are effective tools for Chinese learning, that impact students’ motivation, self-efficacy progress, and learning satisfaction. However, more in-depth research should explore how games and ITS can best be implemented to teach Chinese to foreigners.<br/></div> Copyright © 2022, The Authors.

In addition to the positive impact on learning through these channels, there are also risks related to toxic content like ""fake news"" on various social media. Fake news aims to change opinions based on disinformation or misinformation supporting conspiracy theories, e.g., related to the pandemic. Fake news creators use various multimedia artifacts, including images taken from serious and valid news sources, to attract the audience’s attention. Tracking images in different contexts can give social media users important clues to distinguish fake news from credible information. We report on the development of a web-based learning environment that includes a ""virtual learning companion"" to help learners improve their understanding, awareness, and critical thinking concerning such social media threats. The learning environment mimics Instagram and includes toxic and non-toxic content in a controlled way. The companion is implemented as a browser plugin that communicates with students via chat. The companion poses knowledge activation questions and answers according to an underlying script. The companion offers other sources with the same image identified through Reverse Image Search (RIS). The goal is to help learners find the same image in different contexts with different textual descriptions and keywords. For this purpose, we added basic NLP mechanisms to extract keywords from these contexts, including keywords that signal persuasiveness. Currently, we evaluate the impact of this tool and the provided support in distinguishing fake or credible news.<br/></div> © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09680-8_25","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Fake detection;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;Search engines;Social networking (online);","","03029743","English","AI-based learning support system;Awareness tool;Chatbots;Fake news;Gamification;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning companion system;Learning companion systems;Learning support systems;Misinformation;Recommendation;Social media;Tutoring system;XAPI;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

This task is particularly problematic when it comes to the estimation of the human pose in three dimensions. In fact, while the perception of an object in three dimensions is easy for humans due to the mastering of 3D mental model through years, this task is harder to replicate in computer vision. In this paper, we describe an approach that aims at estimating poses from video with the objective of reproducing the observed behaviors by a virtual avatar. We are motivated by two main objectives. First, we aim at the estimation of 3D poses in video. We use a fully convolutional model based on temporal (dilated) convolutions over 2D keypoints to achieve the estimation of these 3D poses. Secondly, we set the objective to transfer 3D coordinates for previously estimated poses to a virtual avatar. The idea behind this transfer is to reproduce observed behavior in a video by a virtual avatar. Our strategy of employing temporal convolutions in lifting 2D keypoints to 3D keypoints yields better results than previous methods that attempt similar reconstruction. Finally, we use an image-based position transfer to recreate the behaviors derived from the video on the skeleton of a virtual avatar. With our approach we create learning avatar that could be used in different applications.<br/></div> © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09680-8_18","","","3D modeling;Cell proliferation;Computer vision;E-learning;Object detection;Three dimensional computer graphics;Virtual reality;","","03029743","English","3D human pose estimation;3D pose estimation;Behavior reproduction;Human pose estimations;Keypoints;Learning avatar;Objects detection;Three dimensions;Video estimation;Virtual avatar;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks.<br/></div> © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116670","","","E-learning;Domain Knowledge;Computer aided instruction;Computer games;Online systems;Learning systems;Long short-term memory;","","09574174","English","CNN models;Deep knowledge;Deep knowledge tracing;Deep learning;Educational game;Gameplay;Knowledge tracings;Learner modeling;Performance;Prediction of player performance;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

"Personalized feedback in digital learning environments: Classification framework and literature review","Maier, Uwe and Klotz, Christian","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2022","Engineering Village","","3","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Digital learning technologies offer many opportunities to personalize instruction and learning in K-12 and higher education. In the last ten years, a growing body of research described personalized feedback implementations and investigated their effects on educational outcomes. Building on personalized education and adaptive learning systems models, this review provides an analytic framework to summarize key features of personalized feedback implementations and main empirical results. The systematic literature search resulted in 39 studies published in the last ten years. We found that scholars developed and investigated personalized feedback on the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale of digital learning environments. However, the adaptive sources (To what is feedback adapted?) are mainly restricted to the current knowledge level and learning behavior data. Other interesting data sources for feedback adaptation remain underresearched, e.g., emotional state measures, progress measures, learning goals, or personality traits. Only a minority of the reviewed studies provided an empirical or theoretical rationale for assigning feedback messages to different types of students. Most studies report positive or at least mixed or neutral effects of personalized feedback on educational outcomes. This review discusses several implications for future directions in research on digitalized and personalized feedback. This study also adds to previous literature reviews on automatic and adaptive feedback that did not clearly distinguish task-adaptiveness and student-adaptiveness in digital feedback examples.<br/></div> © 2022 The Authors","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100080","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Education computing;Learning systems;","","2666920X","English","Adaptive feedback;Adaptiveness;Automated feedback;Classification framework;Digital learning environment;Digital-learning;Environment classification;Literature reviews;Personalized education;Personalized feedback;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

The app is based on a validated analogue reading intervention for second-graders, which has already been partly digitized, aiming to address the gap of theory based educational applications for children. We used the ARCS model to modify the application and especially the agent’s behavior and compared this extended version to a control version in a user study with primary school students, investigating effects on motivation and performance. The children were motivated in both conditions and performed significantly better in one of the two games in the ARCS modeled version.

"Leveraging Granularity: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Pedagogical Policy Induction","Zhou, Guojing and Azizsoltani, Hamoon and Ausin, Markel Sanz and Barnes, Tiffany and Chi, Min","International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","2022","Engineering Village","454 - 500","32","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In interactive e-learning environments such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pedagogical decisions can be made at different levels of granularity. In this work, we focus on making decisions at two levels: whole problems vs. single steps and explore three types of granularity: problem-level only (Prob-Only), step-level only (Step-Only) and both problem and step levels (Both). More specifically, for Prob-Only, our pedagogical agency decides whether the next problem should be a worked example (WE) or a problem-solving (PS). In WEs, students observe how the tutor solves a problem while in PSs students solve the problem themselves. For Step-Only, the agent decides whether to elicit the student’s next solution step or to tell the step directly. Here the student and the tutor co-construct the solution and we refer to this type of task as collaborative problem-solving (CPS). For Both, the agency first decides whether the next problem should be a WE, a PS, or a CPS and based on the problem-level decision, the agent then makes step-level decisions on whether to elicit or tell each step. In a series of classroom studies, we compare the three types of granularity under random yet reasonable pedagogical decisions. Results showed that while Prob-Only may be less effective for High students, Step-Only may be less effective for Low ones, Both can be effective for both High and Low students. Motivated by these findings, we propose and apply an offline, off-policy Gaussian Processes based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework to induce a hierarchical pedagogical policy that makes adaptive, effective decisions at both the problem and step levels. In an empirical classroom study, our results showed that the HRL policy is significantly more effective than a Deep Q-Network (DQN) induced step-level policy and a random yet reasonable step-level baseline policy.<br/></div> © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-021-00269-9","","","Reinforcement learning;Computer aided instruction;","","15604292","English","Classroom study;Collaborative problem solving;E-learning environment;Gaussian Processes;Hierarchical reinforcement learning;Intelligent tutoring system;Making decision;Worked examples;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

"The design, implementation and pilot application of an intelligent online proctoring system for online exams","Jia, Jiyou and He, Yunfan","Interactive Technology and Smart Education","2022","Scopus","112 – 120","19","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to design and implement an intelligent online proctoring system (IOPS) by using the advantage of artificial intelligence technology in order to monitor the online exam, which is urgently needed in online learning settings worldwide. As a pilot application, the authors used this system in an authentic university online exam and checked the proctoring result. Design/methodology/approach: The IOPS adopts the B/S (Browser/Server) architecture. The server side is implemented with programming language C and Python and stores the identification data of all examinees and their important behavior change status, including facial expression, eye and mouth movement and speech. The browser side collects and analyzes multimodal data of the examinee writing the online test locally and transfers the examinee’s most important behavior status change data to the server. Real-time face recognition and voice detection are implemented with the support of open-source software. Findings: The system was integrated into a Web-based intelligent tutoring system for school mathematics education. As a pilot application, the system was also used for online proctored exam in an undergraduate seminar in Peking University during the epidemic period in 2020. The recorded log data show that all students concentrated themselves on the exam and did not leave the camera and did not speak. Originality/value: During the epidemic period of the novel coronavirus outbreak, almost all educational institutions in the world use online learning as the best way to maintain the teaching and learning schedule for all students. However, current online instruction platforms lack the function to prevent the learners from cheating in online exams and cannot guarantee the integrity and equality for all examinees as in traditional classroom exams. The literature review shows that the online proctoring system should become an important component of online exams to tackle the growing online cheating problem. Although such proctoring systems have been developed and put on the market, the practical usage of such systems in authentic exams and its effect have not been reported. Those systems are heavyweight and commercial product and cannot be freely used in education. The light-weight IOPS developed by the authors could meet the need for online exam as a stable and practical approach and could contribute to the growing online learning and distance learning. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","10.1108/ITSE-12-2020-0246","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106017807&doi=10.1108%2fITSE-12-2020-0246&partnerID=40&md5=318ba22c53b3b8b1ec9a65664f4d8ab4","","","","","","","Cited by: 32","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"
"Knowledge interaction enhanced sequential modeling for interpretable learner knowledge diagnosis in intelligent tutoring systems","Gan, Wenbin and Sun, Yuan and Sun, Yi","Neurocomputing","2022","Scopus","36 – 53","488","One of the fundamental tasks when providing personalized tutoring services to learners in online learning systems, such as intelligent tutoring systems and massive open online courses, is the learner knowledge diagnosis (LKD). LKD obtains the learner knowledge proficiency on skills by modeling their learning performance. Learners’ knowledge construction process is not static, but evolves overtime; hence, the evolution of learners’ knowledge proficiency must be dynamically traced. Moreover, considering the wide usage of online learning systems by large numbers of learners, the LKD task also needs to meet the requirements of large-scale assessment and interpretability to explain the diagnosed results. The existing models are either designed for static scenarios or find it difficult to explain the causality between learner performance and knowledge proficiency, as well as the item characteristics. To solve these issues, we propose herein a novel model, called the knowledge interaction-enhanced dynamic LKD (KIEDLKD), to develop learner performance, and hence, dynamically diagnose and trace the evolution of each learner's knowledge proficiency during the exercising activities. We first propose a dynamic LKD framework by unifying the strength of the memory capacity of the key-value memory network to enhance the representation of the knowledge state during learner performance modeling and the interpretability of the Item Response Theory (IRT) to explain the learner performance in terms of knowledge proficiency and item characteristics (i.e., item difficulty and discrimination). In this framework, we diagnose and trace each learner's knowledge proficiency on each knowledge concept (KC) over time and store them into an auxiliary memory using the key-value memory network. We further infer their general proficiencies and the IRT-based item characteristics using another neural network. Moreover, we propose the knowledge interaction concept among KCs and incorporate it into the LKD procedure to further exploit the long-term dependencies in the exercising sequences, thereby devising the KIEDLKD model. We also incorporate the learner-oriented cognitive item difficulty into our model, based on each learner's exercising history, to adaptively model the item difficulty. Based on these factors, our KIEDLKD model can not only output the learners’ knowledge proficiency in a multi-granularity manner but also output the item characteristics, making it possible to interpret the learner performances in terms of their current knowledge states and item characteristics. Extensive experiments are conducted from six perspectives on five real-world datasets to test our model.The results of learner performance prediction demonstrate the superiority of our model on the LKD task. It can also automatically discover the underlying interaction between each pair of latent KCs, and the underlying concepts for each exercise. The ablation study verifies the contributions of each component in our model. Moreover, it can depict the evolution of learner knowledge proficiency in a multi-granularity manner and provide additional information for skill domain analysis, which enables the interpretability of our model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Article","10.1016/j.neucom.2022.02.080","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125693871&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2022.02.080&partnerID=40&md5=7809513166f4a36d57b83c3b5fc90331","","","","","","","Cited by: 19","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"

To empower educators and researchers to advance simulation-based pedagogy, we have developed the Digital Clinical Simulation Suite (DCSS, pronounced ""decks""), an open-source platform for rehearsing for improvisational interactions. Participants are immersed in vignettes of professional practice through video, images, and text, and they are called upon to improvisationally make difficult decisions through recorded audio and text. Tailored data displays support participant reflection, instructional facilitation, and educational research. DCSS is based on six design principles: 1) Community Adaptation, 2) Masked Technical Complexity, 3) Authenticity of Task, 4) Improvisational Voice, 5) Data Access through ""5Rs"", and 6) Extensible AI Coaching. These six principles mean that any educator should be able to create a scenario that learners should engage in authentic professional challenges using ordinary computing devices, and learners and educators should have access to data for reflection, facilitation, and development of AI tools for real-time feedback.

"User’s Knowledge and Information Needs in Information Retrieval Evaluation","El Zein, Dima and da Costa Pereira, C\'{e}lia","","2022","ACM Digital Library","170–178","","The existing evaluation measures for information retrieval algorithms still lack awareness about the user’s cognitive aspects and their dynamics. They often consider an isolated query-document environment and ignore the user’s previous knowledge and his/her motivation behind the query. The retrieval algorithms and evaluation measures that account for those factors limit the result’s relevance to one search session, one query, or one search goal. We present a novel evaluation measure that overcomes this limitation. The framework measures the relevance of a result/document by examining its content and assessing the possible learning outcomes, for a specific user. Hence not all documents are relevant to all users. The proposed evaluation measure rewards the results’ content for their novelty with respect to what the user already knows and what has been previously proposed. The results are also rewarded for their contribution to achieving the search goals/needs. We demonstrate the efficiency of the measure by comparing it to the knowledge gain reported by 361 crowd-sourced users searching the Web across 10 different topics.","","10.1145/3503252.3531325","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3503252.3531325","","","Evaluation, Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Delta, Knowledge Tracing, Personalisation, Search as Learning, Search goals","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"

ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol.","2022","ACM Digital Library","","6","When in front of a classroom, a skilled teacher can read the room, identifying when students are engaged, frustrated, distracted, etc. In recent years we have seen significant changes in the traditional classroom, with virtual classes becoming a normal learning environment. Reasons for this change are the increased popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the disruptions imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is difficult for teachers to read the room in these virtual classrooms, and researchers have begun to look at using sensors to provide feedback to help inform teaching practices. The study presented here sought to ground classroom sensor data in the form of electrodermal activities (EDA) captured using a wrist-worn sensing platform (Empatica E4), with observations about students' emotional engagement in the class. We collected a dataset from eleven students over eight lectures in college-level computer science classes. We trained human annotators who provided ground truth information about student engagement based on in-class observations. Inspired by related work in the field, we implemented an automated data analysis framework, which we used to explore momentary assessments of student engagement in classrooms. Our findings surprised us because we found no significant correlation between the sensor data and our trained observers' data. In this paper, we present our study and framework for automated engagement assessment, and report on our findings that indicate some of the challenges in deploying current technology for real-world, automated momentary assessment of student engagement in the classroom. We offer reflections on our findings and discuss ways forward toward an automated reading the room approach.","","10.1145/3550328","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3550328","","","Electrodermal Activity, Engagements, Momentary Assessments, Students, Wearable","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"
"Exploring the Politeness of Instructional Strategies from Human-Human Online Tutoring Dialogues","Lin, Jionghao and Rakovic, Mladen and Lang, David and Gasevic, Dragan and Chen, Guanliang","","2022","ACM Digital Library","282–293","","Existing research indicates that students prefer to work with tutors who express politely in online human-human tutoring, but excessive polite expressions might lower tutoring efficacy. However, there is a shortage of understanding about the use of politeness in online tutoring and the extent to which the politeness of instructional strategies can contribute to students’ achievement. To address these gaps, we conducted a study on a large-scale dataset (5,165 students and 116 qualified tutors in 18,203 online tutoring sessions) of both effective and ineffective human-human online tutorial dialogues. The study made use of a well-known dialogue act coding scheme to identify instructional strategies, relied on the linguistic politeness theory to analyse the politeness levels of the tutors’ instructional strategies, and utilised Gradient Tree Boosting to evaluate the predictive power of these politeness levels in revealing students’ problem-solving performance. The results demonstrated that human tutors used both polite and non-polite expressions in the instructional strategies. Tutors were inclined to express politely in the strategy of providing positive feedback but less politely while providing negative feedback and asking questions to evaluate students’ understanding. Compared to the students with prior progress, tutors provided more polite open questions to the students without prior progress but less polite corrective feedback. Importantly, we showed that, compared to previous research, the accuracy of predicting student problem-solving performance can be improved by incorporating politeness levels of instructional strategies with other documented predictors (e.g., the sentiment of the utterances).","","10.1145/3506860.3506904","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3506860.3506904","","","Educational Dialogue Analysis, Learning Analytics, Politeness, Prediction, Student Performance","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"

Among educational technologies are remote laboratories, tools that provide the manipulation of real experiments through an online platform, available 24/7, overcoming constraints of time and space. To extract information of the large amount of data generated during interactions, it is necessary to use technology-supported representations, in order to apply techniques capable of analyzing and extracting information from the data generated from interactions with technologies and, finally, enabling learning interventions. Learning Analytics (LA) consist of on measuring, collecting, analyzing and reporting student data during practices. LA combines data mining techniques to extract information and pedagogical intervention.

Unfortunately, existing methods are domain-specific, whereas there are many domains (e.g., subjects, schools) in the real education scene and some domains suffer from the problem of lacking sufficient data. Therefore, how to exploit the knowledge in other domains, to improve the model's performance for target domain remains pretty much open. We term this problem as Domain Adaptation for Knowledge Tracing (DAKT), which aims to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target one for knowledge tracing. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptable method, namely Adaptable Knowledge Tracing (AdaptKT), which contains three phases to explore this problem. Specifically, phase I is instance selection. Given the question texts of two domains, we train an auto-encoder to select and embed similar instances from both domains. Phase II is distribution discrepancy minimizing. After obtaining the selected instances and their linguistic representations, we train a knowledge tracing model and adopt the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of the domain-specific knowledge states. Phase III is fine-tuning of the output layer. We replace the output layer of the model that trained in phase II by a new one to make the knowledge tracing model's output dimension matches the number of knowledge concepts in the target domain. The new output layer is trained while other parameters that before it are frozen. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, where the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptKT for solving DAKT problem. We will public the code on the Github after the acceptance of the paper.","","10.1145/3488560.3498379","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3488560.3498379","","","knowledge tracing, domain adaptation, deep learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"

"What do Students’ Interactions with Online Lecture Videos Reveal about their Learning?","Zhou, Guojing and Umada, Tetsumichi and D'Mello, Sidney","","2022","ACM Digital Library","295–305","","Video viewing is an important component of online learning, yet little is known about what information about learning outcomes can be derived from students’ video control actions. We investigate the extent to which information on student learning is contained in their video-watching clickstreams (e.g. pausing, playing) immediately after watching a video. We analyzed data from 10,492 students who used an online learning platform for their Algebra 1 course. Our experiments encode students’ video-control clickstreams into sequences in several ways (e.g. aggregate actions, shuffle actions, and merge action types), and train Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network models to predict after-video quiz scores (N = 32,482) from the sequences in a student-independent fashion. The results suggest that the action sequences contain a limited amount of information about student learning (r = 0.108 between model-predicted- and actual- quiz scores), with most of the information in simple counts of actions (r = 0.081) rather than the temporal ordering of actions. Combining information from video action sequences and traditional knowledge estimates from item-response theory (IRT) outperformed (r = 0.224) either approach independently. Implications for student modeling and adaptive learning support for viewing lecture videos are discussed.","","10.1145/3503252.3531315","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3503252.3531315","","","LSTM, Online lecture videos, Sequence mining, Video-watching actions","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"

The adaptability of an e-learning course is a challenging task that requires appropriate tools and a well-thought-out architecture. The solution presented in this article is based on the concept of information imprecision and fuzzy control. The proposed fuzzy controller, based on an expert rule base calculates the student's activity in the course in order to determine the questions in tests at the end of successive parts of the course. The solution proposed was implemented in an e-learning Applications of Fuzzy Sets course, which was part of an Artificial Intelligence class. The proposed system successfully adapts the course content to the student's learning style. The article highlights the potential of fuzzy controllers in adaptive e-learning systems. The use of fuzzy controllers makes it possible to take into account the imprecision of information, enabling better handling of uncertainty and variability in the student's learning style. © 2023 The Authors.

"Three Algorithms for Grouping Students: A Bridge Between Personalized Tutoring System Data and Classroom Pedagogy","Lechuga, Christopher G. and Doroudi, Shayan","International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","2023","Engineering Village","843 - 884","33","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">Computer-assisted instructional programs such as intelligent tutoring systems are often used to support blended learning practices in K-12 education, as they aim to meet individual student needs with personalized instruction. While these systems have been shown to be effective under certain conditions, they can be difficult to integrate into pedagogical practices. In this paper, we introduce three group formation algorithms that leverage learning data from the adaptive intelligent tutoring system ALEKS to support pedagogical and collaborative learning practices with ALEKS. Each grouping method was devised for different use cases, but they all utilize a fine-grained multidimensional view of student ability measured across several hundred skills in an academic course. As such, the grouping algorithms not only identify groups of students, but they also determine what areas of ALEKS content each group should focus on. We then evaluate each of the three methods against two alternative baseline methods, which were chosen for their plausibility of being used in practice—one that groups students randomly and one that groups students based on a unidimensional course score. To evaluate these methods, we establish a set of practical metrics based on what we anticipate teachers would care about in practice. Evaluations were performed by simulating mock groupings of students at different time periods for real ALEKS algebra classes that occurred between 2017 and 2019. We show that each devised method obtains more favorable results on the specified metrics than the alternative methods under each use-case. Moreover, we highlight examples where our methods lead to more nuanced groupings than grouping based on a unidimensional measure of ability.<br/></div> © 2022, The Author(s).","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00309-y","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Group theory;K-means clustering;Learning systems;","","15604292","English","Ability grouping;Blended learning;Computer assisted;Group formations;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;K-means++ clustering;Knowledge space theory;Reciprocal peer tutoring;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.612731481","Accepted"

"HHSKT: A learner–question interactions based heterogeneous graph neural network model for knowledge tracing","Ni, Qin and Wei, Tingjiang and Zhao, Jiabao and He, Liang and Zheng, Chanjin","Expert Systems with Applications","2023","Scopus","","215","Knowledge tracing (KT) has evolved into a crucial component of the online education system with the rapid development of online adaptive learning. A key component of the online education system, knowledge tracing (KT) assesses the state of knowledge by tracing each learner's learning activities. The deep KT model, however, is unable to completely extract the features of the questions and skills due to the heterogeneity of the knowledge structure and the sparsity of the interaction records. The model's capacity to handle diverse data is also restricted by over parameterization. Additionally, rather than focusing solely on a precise fit, Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) should stress interpretable feedback to the learner. The deep KT approach's item parameters are still unable to give students useful feedback. This paper proposes to trace learner's short-term attentional knowledge based on heterogeneous hierarchical differentiation, named HHSKT. Hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge structures and short-term memory enhancement will be used to model the effects of different interaction sequences on learners. Specifically, knowledge structure features are extracted by constructing a heterogeneous graph-based graph information augmentation component. Question differentiation parameters are derived by transforming the TrueSkill system. Besides, learners’ history-related practices are emphasized by windowing attention. Comparing regression-based and deep-based knowledge tracing experiments shows that HHSKT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on three real-world benchmark datasets (with an average AUC improvement of up to 3%), demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119334","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143618958&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.119334&partnerID=40&md5=afa00426d42cbcca7ed16135ae48896c","","","","","","","Cited by: 19","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Duplicated"

An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students’ learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students’ learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students’ behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model’s prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","10.1007/s00521-023-08989-w","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173087707&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-023-08989-w&partnerID=40&md5=886564d906b3df584fd9a1030a87a0b6","","","","","","","Cited by: 7; All Open Access, Green Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.611180556","Duplicated"

A human teacher can track the knowledge of students to customize the teaching on students' needs. With the rise of online education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning materials' recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey for the KT literature. We cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets. Besides these, we shed light on key modelling differences between closely related methods and summarize them in an easy-to-understand format.

One type of software aimed at providing a more engaging and educational experience is the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). The ITS system featured in this research is called FAIE, which focuses on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning. The blueprint-based approach allows educators to design content for students, but this raises two challenges. First, designing the content requires technical skills that can be time-consuming for educators with many tasks. Second, it is difficult to immediately codify an educator’s intrinsic knowledge. To tackle these challenges, a Blueprint-designer was created to generate content based on a text prompt from the educator containing key information. The content consists of problems to be answered with correct answers and distractors meant to challenge the student. The process of generating QA-Pairs involves determining a list of possible answers using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model and passing the answers to a Question-Generation (QG) model. The QG model is based on the T5 Transformer model, which was trained to output questions based on the context and answer. Finally, distractors are generated by training a sequence-to-sequence model, BART, on the RACE dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","10.1007/978-3-031-35998-9_27","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169428080&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-35998-9_27&partnerID=40&md5=d51538f43f8036ea066806fd6dffd3df","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45631.6109375","Duplicated"

We aim to analyze the essential techniques and critical educational problems studied by researchers in five AIED-related conferences and journals between 2010 and 2022. We trained and compared different machine learning models and feature extraction techniques to achieve the research objective. After comparing different models and hyperparameter combinations, our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen's kappa of 0.80. Based on the classification results, we identified the top 10 most frequent keywords within each category for every four year period over the past 12 years. Using the classifier, the 10,723 keywords from 2,684 articles were classified into three categories: educational foci, technical solutions, and AIED applications. We find that 'natural language processing' and 'machine learning' are the primary technical keywords in AIED research, and 'deep learning' and 'artificial intelligence' are the trending technical keywords since 2017. Meanwhile, 'massive open online courses', 'self-regulated learning', 'feedback', 'collaborative learning', and 'online learning' are the top educational foci in the field over the last 12 years. 'Intelligent tutoring systems', 'educational data mining', 'knowledge tracing', and 'learning analytics' continue to receive attention as AIED applications of sustained interest.

A key element of an adaptive learning system is the recommendation system, which provides the most suitable resources based on learner profiles. Recommending the most appropriate learning resources to learners has always been a challenge in the field of e-learning. Thus, learners may have difficulties in choosing the appropriate material when faced with a large volume of recommended material during their learning process. This challenge led us to implement a chatbot to help learners improve their learning experience and knowledge. New solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The use of our chatbot integrated in Moodle, named LearningPartnerBot, provides learners a personalized recommendation of learning objects according to two strategies, one based on their knowledge level (KL) and the other based on their learning style (LS). The objective of this article is to compare the learning outcomes obtained after the realization of the two experiments based on these two approaches centered mainly on the use of the LearningPartnerBot. Consequently, the approach of recommending learning objects based on the knowledge level gave promising results by guaranteeing a more adapted learning to the learners. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","10.1007/978-3-031-32883-1_14","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163398134&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-32883-1_14&partnerID=40&md5=09f0dcba353cd668303c537df1b78508","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.976539352","Duplicated"

To this end, AI is used in varying techniques to automate sophisticated functions in UX and thereby changing what UX is apprehended by the users. This is achieved through the development of intelligent interactive systems such as virtual assistants, recommender systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The changes are well received, as technological achievements but create new challenges of trust, explainability and usability to humans, which in turn need to be amended by further advancements of AI in reciprocity. AI can be utilised to enhance the UX of a system while the quality of the UX can influence the effectiveness of AI. The state of the art in AI for UX is constantly evolving, with a growing focus on designing transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that prioritise user control and autonomy, protect user data privacy and security, and promote diversity and inclusivity in the design process. Staying up to date with the latest advancements and best practices in this field is crucial. This paper conducts a critical analysis of published academic works and research studies related to AI and UX, exploring their interrelationship and the cause-effect cycle between the two.

We aim to analyze the essential techniques and critical educational problems studied by researchers in five AIED-related conferences and journals between 2010 and 2022. We trained and compared different machine learning models and feature extraction techniques to achieve the research objective. After comparing different models and hyperparameter combinations, our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen's kappa of 0.80. Based on the classification results, we identified the top 10 most frequent keywords within each category for every four year period over the past 12 years. Using the classifier, the 10,723 keywords from 2,684 articles were classified into three categories: educational foci, technical solutions, and AIED applications. We find that 'natural language processing' and 'machine learning' are the primary technical keywords in AIED research, and 'deep learning' and 'artificial intelligence' are the trending technical keywords since 2017. Meanwhile, 'massive open online courses', 'self-regulated learning', 'feedback', 'collaborative learning', and 'online learning' are the top educational foci in the field over the last 12 years. 'Intelligent tutoring systems', 'educational data mining', 'knowledge tracing', and 'learning analytics' continue to receive attention as AIED applications of sustained interest.

Recent technological advances in the adjacent areas of natural language processing, machine learning, and computer graphics focusing primarily on design features that can improve their human-like qualities of naturalness and believability as human interlocutors have also amplified new application opportunities for Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) or Animated Pedagogical Agents (APAs) within the area of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). Although AI-powered IVAs hold the potential to improve the learning process in nearly any knowledge domain and personalize automation in teaching by embodying different roles in the learning environment, strikingly few studies have empirically attempted to assess IVAs impact on L2 learners’ academic achievement when learning English as a Foreign (EFL) so far. The present article addresses this issue via a systematic review of relevant interventionist IVA studies that were conducted in EFL settings and published within the 2015–2020 timeframe examining IVAs key affordances, major barriers in their adoption for language learning purposes, and the CALL research trends currently prevalent on the topic.

Brain fog, also known as confusion, is a common cause of poor performance, and real-time detection of confusion is a challenging and important task for applications in online education and driver fatigue detection. In this study, we propose a deep learning method for cognitive load recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals using a long short-term memory network (LSTM) with an attention mechanism. We obtained EEG signal data from a database of brainwave information and associated data on mental load. We evaluated the performance of the proposed LSTM technique in comparison with random forest, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural network models. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach had the highest accuracy of 87.1% compared to those of other algorithms, including random forest (64%), AdaBoost (64.31%), support vector machine (60.9%), XGBoost (67.3%), and artificial neural network models (71.4%).

"Taking Stock of Concept Inventories in Computing Education: A Systematic Literature Review","Ali, Murtaza and Ghosh, Sourojit and Rao, Prerna and Dhegaskar, Raveena and Jawort, Sophia and Medler, Alix and Shi, Mengqi and Dasgupta, Sayamindu","","2023","ACM Digital Library","397–415","","Background and context. Concept inventories (CIs) are a widely used tool in STEM education that can help instructors identify specific misconceptions students hold about key concepts. Over the past several years, much research has been published contributing to CIs in computer science education. Objectives. This research aims to investigate the state of CIs in computer science education through a systematic literature review built around two research questions: 1) What do we know about CIs for computer science today, and 2) Have researchers been able to effectively tackle the 4 challenges specific to computer science CIs outlined by Taylor et al. in their previous 2014 literature review on this topic? Method. We conducted a systematic literature review focusing on CIs in computer science education. We included research from any country, provided it was published in English between 2004 and 2022. We searched with key terms across four databases (Compendex, Inspec, Education Source, and ERIC) and collated a final list of 65 studies for analysis from 175 initial results. Findings. From these 65 papers, we identified 33 total CIs in computer science, 12 of which are currently validated. Of the 65 studies, the majority used established techniques for choosing concepts, identifying misconceptions, and/or developing questions, but a few (n = 4) reported on successful alternative techniques. We found that although no papers explicitly articulated an objective to tackle the aforementioned challenges, they are a recurring theme in the literature and have been addressed in various ways. Implications. At the time of the previous literature review, there were few computer science CIs. Our findings are promising, suggesting that researchers have found effective ways to tackle Taylor et al.’s challenges and that the number of CIs across computer science is gradually increasing. Future work is warranted regarding non-traditional techniques researchers proposed for developing CIs.","","10.1145/3568813.3600120","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3568813.3600120","","","computer science education, computing education, concept inventories, systematic literature review","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45631.496597222","Rejected"

"AI and Cognitive Modelling for Education","Aberšek, Boris and Flogie, Andrej and Pesek, Igor","AI and Cognitive Modelling for Education","2023","Scopus","1 – 229","","This book offers a groundbreaking approach to bridging the gap between various disciplines involved in cognitive modeling in education. By drawing on the fields of learning, neuro science, cognitive science, neurobiology, and computer science, it provides a new perspective on how we can integrate these disciplines with education to create more effective learning environments. The main objective of this book is to delve into the ethical, sociological, and technological questions surrounding the introduction of intelligent and smart learning environments in education. By analyzing these issues, this book aims to bridge the gap between the various disciplines involved in cognitive modeling and education, while highlighting the benefits and risks associated with these advancements. With the emergence of AI-based tutors, coaches, and learning environments, students now have access to a new type of self-learning and self-training that was previously unavailable. Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and the use of computer-assisted learning tools has revolutionized the way we think about education. The goal of education must be to instill in students a desire to learn for themselves, and this can only be achieved through active, self-directed, and reflective learning. With intelligent tutoring systems, students are empowered to take an active role in their own education, rather than simply being passive recipients of information. This book offers practical strategies for teachers to facilitate this transition, enabling them to act as facilitators and guides rather than one-way communicators. By embracing this new approach to education, we can help students become lifelong learners who are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. As we cannot predict the future with certainty, the true effects of education may only be revealed in the long run, making it critical to understand the potential consequencesof introducing these new learning tools.

Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics.

"COVES: A Cognitive-Affective Deep Model that Personalizes Math Problem Difficulty in Real Time and Improves Student Engagement with an Online Tutor","Yu, Hao and Allessio, Danielle A. and Lee, Will and Rebelsky, William and Sylvia, Frank and Murray, Tom and Magee, John J. and Arroyo, Ivon and Woolf, Beverly P. and Bargal, Sarah Adel and Betke, Margrit","MM 2023 - Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Multimedia","2023","Scopus","6152 – 6160","","A key to personalized online learning is presenting content at an appropriate difficulty level; content that is too difficult can cause frustration and content that is too easy may result in boredom. Appropriate content can improve students' engagement and learning outcome. In this research, we propose a computer vision enhanced problem selector (COVES), a deep learning model to select a personalized difficulty level for each student. A combination of visual information and traditional log data is used to predict student-problem interactions, which are then used to guide problem difficulty selection in real time. COVES was trained on a dataset of fifty-one sixth-grade students interacting with the online math tutor MathSpring. Once COVES was integrated into the tutor, its effectiveness was tested with twenty-two seventh-grade students in controlled experiments. Students who received problems at an appropriate difficulty level, based on real-time predictions of their performance, demonstrated improved engagement with the math tutor. Results indicate that COVES leads to higher mastery of math concepts, better timing, and higher scores, thus providing a positive learning experience for the participants. © 2023 Owner/Author.","Conference paper","10.1145/3581783.3613965","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179554437&doi=10.1145%2f3581783.3613965&partnerID=40&md5=ab3fd5ff5d9dac2415d263da911106d7","","","","","","","Cited by: 1; All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.503553241","Rejected"

"Adaptive Learning System Based on Knowledge Graph","Lin, Longcheng and Wang, Fang","","2023","ACM Digital Library","","","Since the rapid development of ""Internet+Education"" , various artificial intelligence technologies have been applied to teaching and learning. The development of technology has brought great impetus and potential to education. Based on the background of big data, how to use AI technology to mine valuable information in massive data to meet the adaptive learning needs of learners is an important topic that deserves attention and research. This paper builds learner ontology and course knowledge ontology, links learning resources to course knowledge ontology to build domain knowledge graph, designs and implements an adaptive learning system based on knowledge graph, including learner model, domain knowledge model, adaptive learning engine and interactive interface. Finally, Pellet inference engine is used to infer the designed SWRL rules. The result shows that the adaptive learning system proposed in this paper can recommend appropriate learning paths according to the learners' learning status, and present personalized learning resources.","","10.1145/3599640.3599647","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3599640.3599647","","","recommendation, personalized learning, ontology construction, knowledge graph, Adaptive learning system","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45631.551967593","Rejected"
"ML-Based Teaching Systems: A Conceptual Framework","Spitzer, Philipp and K\""{u}hl, Niklas and Heinz, Daniel and Satzger, Gerhard","Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.","2023","ACM Digital Library","","7","As the shortage of skilled workers continues to be a pressing issue, exacerbated by demographic change, it is becoming a critical challenge for organizations to preserve the knowledge of retiring experts and pass it on to novices. While this knowledge transfer has traditionally occurred through personal interaction, it lacks scalability and requires significant resources and time. IT-based teaching systems have addressed this scalability issue, but their development is still tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) models to facilitate knowledge transfer in an organizational context, leading to more cost-effective IT-based teaching systems. Through a systematic literature review, we examine key concepts, themes, and dimensions to understand better and design ML-based teaching systems. To do so, we capture and consolidate the capabilities of ML models in IT-based teaching systems, inductively analyze relevant concepts in this context, and determine their interrelationships. We present our findings in the form of a review of the key concepts, themes, and dimensions to understand and inform on ML-based teaching systems. Building on these results, our work contributes to research on computer-supported cooperative work by conceptualizing how ML-based teaching systems can preserve expert knowledge and facilitate its transfer from SMEs to human novices. In this way, we shed light on this emerging subfield of human-computer interaction and serve to build an interdisciplinary research agenda.","","10.1145/3610197","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3610197","","","ML-based teaching system, human-AI interaction, human-computer interaction, machine learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45631.517997685","Rejected"

"Acceptance of artificial intelligence in teaching science: Science teachers' perspective","Abdulla {Al Darayseh}","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2023","ScienceDirect","100132","4","Over the last few decades, there has been growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and how to apply it effectively in the educational process. The behavioural intention and attitudes of teachers play an important role in this regard. The technology acceptance model (TAM) has been shown to be effective in predicting factors that may positively or negatively influence behavioural intentions to use technology. The current study therefore aims to use this model to reveal teachers’ perceptions of the factors that influence the use of AI applications in science education. This research uses the descriptive method where a 6-dimensional scale is designed based on the components of the TAM model and then applied to a sample of 83 science teachers in Abu Dhabi. The results show a high acceptability of the use of AI in the classroom by science teachers, with positive correlations to self-efficacy, ease of use, expected benefits, attitudes, and behavioural intentions. However, anxiety and stress do not significantly affect other factors. Regarding the predictive power of research models, the combined factors expected benefits, ease of use, and attitude toward AI applications can predict 71.4% of future behavioural changes related to the use of AI applications in science teaching. This study finds no statistically significant differences in teacher responses based on the variables gender, teaching experience, and qualifications regarding teachers’ behavioural intentions to actually use AI in science teaching.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100132","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000115","","","Artificial intelligence, Science teachers, Technology acceptance model, Self-efficacy, Anxiety and stress","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

In the era of “artificial intelligence”, the main features of ideological and political education in colleges are the development of the intelligence revolution, the development of teaching concepts, and the omnipotence of teaching content, and teaching methods. This study further explores the necessity and development of “artificial intelligence technology” in college ideological and political education through a questionnaire survey, and promotes the organic integration of artificial intelligence and ideological and political education. The results show that [1] College students have positive attitudes toward the application of artificial intelligence in college ideological and political education, and college students are looking forward to the intelligent services and changes brought by artificial intelligence technology in college ideological and political education [2]. According to the results of the questionnaire survey, this paper proposes the development path of college ideological and political education in the era of artificial intelligence, that is, schools and teachers need to improve the transformation of traditional education as well as the construction of contemporary Internet education. This study offers the possibility of interdisciplinary research, expands the scope of ideological and political education research, and provides a reference for front-line teaching to a certain extent.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13403","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023006102","","","Artificial intelligence, Colleges, Ideological and political education, Precision education, Big data","","2405-8440","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"Towards Intelligent-TPACK: An empirical study on teachers’ professional knowledge to ethically integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools into education","Ismail Celik","Computers in Human Behavior","2023","ScienceDirect","107468","138","The affordances of artificial intelligence (AI) have not been totally utilized in education. To effectively integrate AI into education, teachers’ AI-specific technological and pedagogical knowledge is important. Furthermore, due to novel ethical issues caused by Al, teachers also must have the knowledge to assess AI-based decisions. None of the previous studies so far explored teacher knowledge to pedagogically and ethically use AI-based tools. Considering this gap, we first developed a scale to measure the knowledge for instructional AI use based on the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework. We extended TPACK with ethical aspects. Secondly, we built a model to investigate the interplay of TPACK components and ethics. The results indicated that as long as teachers have more knowledge to interact with AI-based tools, they will have a better understanding of the pedagogical contributions of AI. Further, technological knowledge (TK) allows teachers to better assess decisions of AI. However, only TK is not sufficient educational integration of AI-based tools. For teachers to deploy AI in education efficiently, TK is meaningful when it is combined with pedagogical knowledge (PK), reflected in technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK). Given pedagogical and technological affordances of AI-based tools, the current study suggests the Intelligent-TPACK framework.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107468","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222002886","","","Artificial intelligence, Teacher education, Technology integration, TPACK","","0747-5632","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

In this context, during the pandemic, educational institutions around the globe recognized the benefits of adopting remote learning and teaching based on many e-learning platforms. Hence, deploying virtual classrooms is not that easy, due to many constraints, such as time, technological cost, lack of interactivity of learners, and the unsuitability of the learner's cognitive abilities and learning style. To this end, understanding the learner's style and providing adapted and personalized content are the main concerns of today's e-learning systems. To this end, integrating efficient recommender systems into online learning environment is required in order to consider student's behaviors and preferences when recommending various learning materials.

Despite using the traditional educational structure, military colleges have embraced this new technology. This research analyzed the present adoption rate, difficulties, and solutions for implementing an AI-based online education system. The results demonstrate that digital technology has a tangible impact on all facets of higher education if it is supported by the institution. The results also indicate that the organization plays a crucial role in the integration of digital technology into teaching and learning, and that an examination of the materiality already present in the Collaborative Technical Education (CTE) organization is necessary for comprehending the potential effects of new digital technology. Finally, this paper addressed how AI can make e-learning more interesting, efficient, and tailored to each individual learner, all of which contribute to better learning outcomes and wider access to technical education. The details of how artificial intelligence can be used to promote diversity and equity in the classroom are laid out.

"Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and higher education: A systematic review","Bahar Memarian and Tenzin Doleck","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2023","ScienceDirect","100152","5","Background
The use of Artificial Intelligence or AI is rising in higher education. With this rise, the morality of AI programs is being questioned. There is, as such, a need to understand how notions of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics or FATE are identified in the AI and higher education studies to date.
Purpose
This systematic review paper aims to understand definitions and studies on FATE and AI in the higher education literature. The contribution of this work is to provide a summary of FATE development and the synthesis of the challenges and potentials of each of the reviewed studies.
Method
A total of 33 publications from SCOPUS and Web of Science (WoS) were included in this systematic literature review. We examined definitions of FATE noted in the reviewed articles (may have been multiple in each study) and grouped them into descriptive (understandable by laypeople) and technical (containing jargon) definitions. We also examined the main FATE term studied in detail in each reviewed article and grouped them into qualitative and quantitative studies.
Results
Findings show more descriptive definitions exist (especially for fairness) and similarly quantitative definitions mostly emerge for Fairness. Findings also show more quantitative studies exist (especially for fairness) and qualitative definitions mostly emerge for ethics. Generally, though, there are more definitions than relevant studies conducted in the literature.
Conclusion
This systematic literature review offers a summary of definitions and studies conducted for FATE terms and AI in the higher education literature. Future work may benefit from bridging the gap between laypeople and experts by linking descriptive definitions with technical ones as well as qualitative studies with quantitative ones. Moreover, future work can study accountability and transparency further and make the study of FATE terms more longitudinal, open-access, and reproducible.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100152","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000310","","","Artificial intelligence, Higher education, Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

Next, we provide a primer on ML models that are often included in LA. We then explain how LA with ML can adapt and provide recommendations based on students' needs as well as immediate feedback to students and score reports to teachers and other stakeholders. Finally, we address the current trends and opportunities within LA and how within this current time in history LA could be more useful than ever in helping all students achieve their educational goals.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818630-5.10050-8","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128186305100508","","","Learning analytics, Educational data mining, Machine learning, Personalization, Digital learning environments","Elsevier","","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"
"Designing an artificial intelligence tool to understand student engagement based on teacher's behaviours and movements in video conferencing","Navdeep Verma and Dr Seyum Getenet and Dr Christopher Dann and Thanveer Shaik","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2023","ScienceDirect","100187","5","Video conferencing is an effective tool that promotes interaction and collaboration, increasing student engagement in online learning. This study is the second phase of design-based research to create a tool to generate a report of engaging teaching videos using deep learning as an artificial intelligence (AI) methodology. In this second phase, the authors have applied the characteristics and indicators of engaging teaching videos identified in the first phase, reported in another study, to develop an Artificial Intelligence enabled tool. Twenty-five recorded lecture videos presented to higher education students were annotated based on the indicators and characteristics of engaging teaching videos. An AI expert has assisted the authors in creating the Artificial Intelligence-enabled tool from the reports generated by this manual annotation. With the assistance of this tool, the engagement enhancing teachers' behaviours and movements can be identified from recorded lecture videos, and a report can be generated on engaging teaching videos. For the classification task of video analysis, the deep learning model is adopted in this research. The model is trained with manually annotated videos and determines class imbalance issues and misleading metrics. The model was further improved by adopting the oversampling technique. The second version of the tool achieved promising outputs with average precision, recall, f1-score, and balanced accuracy of 68, 75, 73, and 79%, respectively, in classifying the annotated videos at the indicator level. The tool can assist the education institutes in creating moderation in the lecture delivery and whether the teachers are utilising the technology effectively. Additionally, this can help teachers recognise the presence or absence of engagement-enhancing behaviours and movements during their video conferencing sessions.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100187","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000668","","","Artificial intelligence, Video conferencing, Teachers' behaviours, Teachers' movements","","2666-920X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"Real-time hand interaction and self-directed machine learning agents in immersive learning environments","Muhammad Zahid Iqbal and Abraham G. Campbell","Computers & Education: X Reality","2023","ScienceDirect","100038","3","Integration of extended reality (XR) in education is becoming popular to transform the traditional classroom with immersive learning environments. The adoption of immersive learning is accelerating as an innovative approach for science and engineering subjects. With new powerful interaction techniques in XR and the latest developments in artificial intelligence, interactive and self-directed learning are becoming important. However, there is a lack of research exploring these emerging technologies research with kinesthetic learning or “hands-one learning"" as a pedagogical approach using real-time hand interaction and agent-guided learning in immersive environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses machine learning agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in science and engineering education through real-time hand interaction in the virtual world. To implement the following approach, this paper uses a chemistry-related case study and presents a usability evaluation conducted with 15 expert reviewers and 2 subject experts. NASA task load index is used for cognitive workload measurement, and the technology acceptance model is used for measuring perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the evaluations. The evaluation with expert reviewers proposed self-directed learning using trained agents can help in the end-user training in learning technical topics and controller-free hand interaction for kinesthetic tasks can improve hands-on learning motivation in virtual laboratories. This success points to a novel research area where agents embodied in an immersive environment using machine learning techniques can forge a new pedagogical approach where they can act as both teacher and assessor.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cexr.2023.100038","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949678023000326","","","Mixed reality, Virtual reality, Extended reality, Technology enhanced learning, Immersive learning, XR, Learning technology","","2949-6780","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"HHSKT: A learner–question interactions based heterogeneous graph neural network model for knowledge tracing","Qin Ni and Tingjiang Wei and Jiabao Zhao and Liang He and Chanjin Zheng","Expert Systems with Applications","2023","ScienceDirect","119334","215","Knowledge tracing (KT) has evolved into a crucial component of the online education system with the rapid development of online adaptive learning. A key component of the online education system, knowledge tracing (KT) assesses the state of knowledge by tracing each learner’s learning activities. The deep KT model, however, is unable to completely extract the features of the questions and skills due to the heterogeneity of the knowledge structure and the sparsity of the interaction records. The model’s capacity to handle diverse data is also restricted by over parameterization. Additionally, rather than focusing solely on a precise fit, Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) should stress interpretable feedback to the learner. The deep KT approach’s item parameters are still unable to give students useful feedback. This paper proposes to trace learner’s short-term attentional knowledge based on heterogeneous hierarchical differentiation, named HHSKT. Hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge structures and short-term memory enhancement will be used to model the effects of different interaction sequences on learners. Specifically, knowledge structure features are extracted by constructing a heterogeneous graph-based graph information augmentation component. Question differentiation parameters are derived by transforming the TrueSkill system. Besides, learners’ history-related practices are emphasized by windowing attention. Comparing regression-based and deep-based knowledge tracing experiments shows that HHSKT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on three real-world benchmark datasets (with an average AUC improvement of up to 3%), demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119334","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422023521","","","Intelligent education, Knowledge tracing, Graph neural network, Educational data mining","","0957-4174","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.107903","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223002546","","","Artificial intelligence, Education, Competencies, Robot tutors","","0747-5632","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

However, the closure of schools for over six months at the onset of the covid -19 pandemic, and the inability of schools to engage learners in educational activities while at home also revealed the poor state of the education system in the country, which led to the discovery of the unavailability of distance online education, web-based learning system and ICT infrastructure in the Nigerian education environment. Covid-19 incidence impacted the stability of the academic calendar, caused teachers attrition, increased the rate of students dropout, and lack of interest in digital education. These outcomes resulted in the exploration of students' and teachers’ perceptions, attitudes, literacy, competency, and willingness to engage in distance online education. A cross-sectional approach was applied through an online survey to obtain data from n = 82 learners across the three levels of institutions. And SPSS was used to analyze the demography data, while SMART PLS was used for structural equation modeling (SEM).

All these measures ultimately improve learner satisfaction which gets reflected in the learner performance and makes the course popular. Due to the corona pandemic, educational institutes and universities have shifted their activities online. In such a scenario, it is challenging to identify a course's popularity and the factors that make it popular. In this work, the authors have performed aspect-based sentiment analysis of learner feedback to identify the essential aspects of creating a popular course. The traditional methods for analysing feedback for sentiment analysis require manual intervention and are tedious. The authors have proposed a framework that identifies learner reviews' aspect level sentiment polarity and selected the significant aspects impacting a course's popularity. Experimental work is conducted over a large-scale real-world education dataset containing around 110 K learner comments (referred to as Educational Dataset now onwards) collected from Coursera1 and learner data from academic institution MSIT2. Different word embeddings viz., FastText, Word2Vec (Word2Vector), GloVe (Global representation of Vectors), and user-created embeddings are used for CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models. These models are further compared with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers), EvoMSA (Evolutionary Multilingual Sentiment Analysis) and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Model) classifiers to find the method that works best for identifying the aspects that impact the popularity of a course.

This paper aims to identify the similarities and differences between FC developed in the Spanish formal educational context concerning the theory of SLE. This study follows an exploratory research methodology using an ad hoc questionnaire applied transversally to a representative sample of teachers involved in the SLE (N = 66). SPSS V. 28 software was used. In relation to the results, some statistics (mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness) were used to analyse the developed FC practices and professional satisfaction. In conclusion, the FC are at an initial stage of development in Spain, and although they could represent an approximation to what would be the practical basis of SLE, there are still several aspects to be developed, especially in relation to the technologies used and the dimension of attention to diversity. In relation to SLE technologies, they are related to the automation of certain processes and include artificial intelligence, learning analytics and sensors, among others. On the other hand, these technologies are not widely used in the FC, and the use of other more conventional technological resources, such as interactive whiteboards, online collaborative environments, LMS platforms, etc. In terms of attention to diversity, despite the existence of initiatives to personalise the learning experience in FC, assistive technologies are not considered, nor is automatic personalisation through certain SLE technologies.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18577","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023057857","","","Smart learning environments, Future classroom, Educational technology, Primary education, Secondary education","","2405-8440","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

"Diversified resource access paths in MOOCs: Insights from network analysis","Shuang Li and Junlei Du and Shu Yu","Computers & Education","2023","ScienceDirect","104869","204","The low access rate to resources and learner diversity of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has led to a shift in MOOC resource design toward how to better support adaptive learning through personalized recommendation, highlighting the importance of exploring diversified access paths for MOOC resources and their dynamics. Nevertheless, most studies have explored the MOOC learning process from the perspective of behavior sequences or activity distributions, thus limiting the ability to reveal the diversified paths learners use to access MOOC resources. From a perspective of network analysis, this study used log data generated by 12,468 participants from a Chinese MOOC to build resource access networks of learners with resources as nodes. This data was then used to investigate learners’ diversified paths to access content-related resources by examining the structure and dynamics of the networks. Learners with different engagement and achievement levels differ in chapter access paths, specific resource access paths, and the dynamic characteristics of their access behavior patterns. Compared with the scattered, localized, and short access paths of the subpopulations not taking the exam, the final exam-taker subpopulations showed coherent, expanded and long access paths across all chapters and tended to use quizzes as scaffolding for other resources within and across chapters. Notably, successful learners showed a trend of reciprocity in resource access early in the course, an important feature that distinguished them from the other subpopulations. The findings inform the design of personalized resource recommendation systems for adaptive learning in MOOCs.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104869","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013152300146X","","","Data science applications in education, Distance education and online learning, Informal learning, Adult learning, Lifelong learning","","0360-1315","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

In this paper, we analyse teachers’ perceptions about the use of the metaverse in educational practices and how it contributes to the local development. We focused our study in China and Spain as reference countries in the metaverse, but whose collaboration, in this arena, is not significant. For that purpose, we designed a questionnaire to explore the views of 20 teachers from each of the two universities selected, one in China and the other one in Spain, which applies an innovation and entrepreneurship education. The results show that the educational use of the metaverse is in its initial experimentation phase. Its application in innovation and entrepreneurship education is not limited to teachers' attitudes towards teaching, but rather to how the use of metaverse allows students to acquire real skills, which can contribute to the development of the society and improve international cooperation, thus creating a virtuous circle. Faculty training and university facilities remain limited for its implementation. Further research is needed on the data protection and privacy aspects on the practical educational use of metaverse.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100185","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000644","","","Augmented and virtual reality, Improving classroom teaching, Learning communities, Teacher professional development, Teaching/learning strategies","","2666-920X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Plastic gating network: Adapting to personal development and individual differences in knowledge tracing","Zhihan Li and Shengquan Yu and Yu Lu and Penghe Chen","Information Sciences","2023","ScienceDirect","761-776","624","Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the issue of predicting learners’ knowledge states based on their learning history and is the core technology for computer-assisted adaptive learning. The latest KT research has improved prediction performance by exploring the relationship between concepts and questions. However, these models have their parameters fixed after training. Without fully or partially re-training, they can only predict all learners’ performance at all time steps using the same set of parameters, making them challenging to adapt to learners’ personal development and individual differences. To address these problems, we take inspiration from synaptic plasticity, the primary neural mechanism conferring biological brains with lifelong learning capabilities, and propose the plastic gating network (PGN) to adapt to variation in learners’ cognition over time and across individuals. At the core of the proposed model are plastic weights, which can constantly evolve after training according to the ongoing inputs and outputs. We adopt plastic weights in calculating gates and cell input in recurrent units, thus allowing the model to develop time- and individual-specific parameters that adapt to learners’ personal development and individual differences after training. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed PGN outperforms baseline methods in predicting the future performance of learners. Crucially, the PGN exhibits effective adaptation to learners’ personal development and individual differences.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2023.01.011","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025523000129","","","Knowledge tracing, Plastic weights, Personal development, Individual differences, Recurrent neural networks","","0020-0255","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

The adoption of developmentally appropriate practices using AI-enabled techniques for facilitating the performance of teaching and learning in the higher education domain is thus a necessary task, especially in the COVID 19 pandemic era. The development and implementation of such techniques involve many factors and are related to the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) issue; however, these factors surrounding supervisors will confuse them and may result in misjudgment. To clarify the relevant issues and illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships among factors, a hybrid soft-computing technique (i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony optimization (ACO)) and a DEMATEL approach was proposed in this study, which can help decision makers capture the best model necessary for achieving aspiration-level in a higher education management strategy. In the results submitted, the improvement priority for dimensions is based on the measurement of the influences, running in order of tutors for learners (A), skills and competences (B), interaction data to support learning (C), and universal access to global classrooms (D), and which can serve as a reference for the plan of AI-enabled teaching/learning for higher education.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118762","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422017808","","","Artificial intelligence, Higher education, Fuzzy rough set theory (FRST), Ant colony optimization (ACO), Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)","","0957-4174","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

To facilitate the knowledge understanding and personalized learning of users in online learning communities, it is necessary to conduct a fine-grained analysis of user data to capture their dynamical learning characteristics and potential knowledge levels, so as to recommend appropriate learning paths. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained and multi-context-aware learning path recommendation model for online learning communities based on a knowledge graph. First, we design a multidimensional knowledge graph to solve the problem of monotonous and incomplete entity information presentation of the single layer knowledge graph. Second, we use the topic preference features of users’ postings to determine the starting point of learning paths. We then strengthen the distant relationship of knowledge in the global context using the multidimensional knowledge graph when generating and recommending learning paths. Finally, we build a user background similarity matrix to establish user connections in the local context to recommend users with similar knowledge levels and learning preferences and synchronize their subsequent postings. Experiment results show that the proposed model can recommend appropriate learning paths for users, and the recommended similar users and postings are effective.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103464","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457323002017","","","Learning path recommendation, Knowledge graph, Online learning community, User recommendation","","0306-4573","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"EDFA: Ensemble deep CNN for assessing student's cognitive state in adaptive online learning environments","Swadha Gupta and Parteek Kumar and RajKumar Tekchandani","International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering","2023","ScienceDirect","373-387","4","Ensuring student engagement is crucial for effective learning outcomes in any classroom setting, including e-learning environments. However, the absence of immediate supervision in online classes makes monitoring and maintaining student attentiveness difficult. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cognitive state detection system that continuously monitors the facial emotion of the learner in an adaptive learning environment. The algorithm is proposed to detect cognitive states such as attentiveness and inattentiveness. The system has been implemented on four separate databases and evaluated using three ensemble models: FT-EDFA, FC-EDFA, and OT-EDFA. The ensemble models have been created by applying transfer learning to two popular pre-trained models, VGG19 and ResNet50, which can learn useful features from facial images for emotion recognition tasks. Combining the features learned by both models, the ensemble approach can achieve better performance in recognising facial emotions. The proposed system can provide continuous feedback to instructors, enabling them to adjust their teaching methods to maintain student engagement and interest. The study has achieved promising results, surpassing the performance of existing methods with recognition rates of 93.11%, 92.34%, and 91.12% on the newly created dataset. By detecting cognitive states in online learners, the proposed system can help instructors understand how engaged and interested their students are during classes. Overall, facial emotion recognition can be useful for improving the quality of e-learning platforms and enhancing student learning outcomes.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcce.2023.11.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666307423000359","","","Facial emotion, VGG19, ResNet50, Online learning, Deep learning, Cognitive state","","2666-3074","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"AI-based learning content generation and learning pathway augmentation to increase learner engagement","Chaitali Diwan and Srinath Srinivasa and Gandharv Suri and Saksham Agarwal and Prasad Ram","Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","2023","ScienceDirect","100110","4","Retaining learner engagement is a major challenge in online learning environments, which is even more intensified with learning spaces increasingly built by combining resources from multiple independent sources. Narrative-centric learning experience has been found to improve learner engagement by several researchers. Towards this end, we propose an AI-based approach that generates auxiliary learning content called narrative fragments which are interspersed into the learning pathways to create interactive learning narratives. The proposed approach consists of the automatic generation of two types of narrative fragments– overviews of the learning pathway segments and reflection quizzes or formative assessments from learning resources in any format including open educational resources. The pipeline for the generation of the narrative fragments consists of various components based on different semantic models and a natural language generation (NLG) component based on a pre-trained language model GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2). Automation enables the generation of narrative fragments on the fly whenever there are changes in the learning pathway due to the need for reiteration of concepts, pre-requisite knowledge acquisition, etc., enabling adaptability in the learning pathways. The proposed approach is domain agnostic which makes it easily adaptable to different domains. The NLG model is evaluated using ROUGE scores against several baselines. Automatically generated narrative fragments are evaluated by human evaluators. We obtained encouraging results in both cases.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100110","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000650","","","Learner engagement, Open educational resources, Curating learning pathways, Educational content generation, Language models, Definition generation, Automatic question generation, Multiple choice question","","2666-920X","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Seeing that the current research pays less attention to teachers' and students’ preferences for the space environment simultaneously, based on the survey of 1937 undergraduates and 107 teachers from a university in central China, this study aims to explore their preferences for smart learning environment. Based on the ecological theory and research results of the existing learning environment, this paper constructed an ecological model and a conceptual model of learning space preferences. An empirical study was conducted to explore the impact of sociodemographic variables on personal spatial preference.

"Wse-MF: A weighting-based student exercise matrix factorization model","Xia Sun and Bo Li and Richard Sutcliffe and Zhizezhang Gao and Wenying Kang and Jun Feng","Pattern Recognition","2023","ScienceDirect","109285","138","Students who have been taught new ideas need to develop their skills by carrying out further work in their own time. This often consists of a series of exercises which must be completed. While students can choose exercises themselves from online sources, they will learn more quickly and easily if the exercises are specifically tailored to their needs. A good teacher will always aim to do this, but with the large groups of students who typically take advantage of open online courses, it may not be possible. Exercise prediction, working with large-scale matrix data, is a better way to address this challenge, and a key stage within such prediction is to calculate the probability that a student will answer a given question correctly. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach called Weighting-based Student Exercise Matrix Factorization (Wse-MF) which combines student learning ability and exercise difficulty as prior weights. In order to learn how to complete the matrix, we apply an iterative optimization method that makes the approach practical for large-scale educational deployment. Compared with eight models in cognitive diagnosis and matrix factorization, our research results suggest that Wse-MF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of real-world datasets in both prediction quality and time complexity. Moreover, we find that there is an optimal value of the latent factor K (the inner dimension of the factorization) for each dataset, which is related to the relationship between skills and exercises in that dataset. Similarly, the optimal value of hyperparameter c0 is linked to the ratio between exercises and students. Taken as a whole, we demonstrate improvements to matrix factorization within the context of educational data.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2022.109285","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320322007646","","","Educational data mining, Personalized exercise prediction, Matrix factorization","","0031-3203","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Genetic hyperparameter optimization with Modified Scalable-Neighbourhood Component Analysis for breast cancer prognostication","Shtwai Alsubai and Abdullah Alqahtani and Mohemmed Sha","Neural Networks","2023","ScienceDirect","240-257","162","Breast cancer is common among women resulting in mortality when left untreated. Early detection is vital so that suitable treatment could assist cancer from spreading further and save people’s life. The traditional way of detection is a time-consuming process. With the evolvement of DM (Data Mining), the healthcare industry could be benefitted in predicting the disease as it permits the physicians to determine the significant attributes for diagnosis. Though, conventional techniques have used DM-based methods to identify breast cancer, they lacked in terms of prediction rate. Moreover, parametric-Softmax classifiers have been a general option by conventional works with fixed classes, particularly when huge labelled data are present during training. Nevertheless, this turns into an issue for open set cases where new classes are encountered along with few instances to learn a generalized parametric classifier. Thus, the present study aims to implement a non-parametric strategy by optimizing the embedding of a feature rather than parametric classifiers. This research utilizes Deep CNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) and Inception V3 for learning visual features which preserve neighbourhood outline in semantic space relying on NCA (Neighbourhood Component Analysis) criteria. Delimited by its bottleneck, the study proposes MS-NCA (Modified Scalable-Neighbourhood Component Analysis) that relies on a non-linear objective function to perform feature fusion by optimizing the distance-learning objective due to which it gains the capability of computing inner feature products without performing mapping which increases the scalability of MS-NCA. Finally, G-HPO (Genetic-Hyper-parameter Optimization) is proposed. In this case, the new stage in the algorithm simply denotes the enhancement in the length of chromosome bringing several hyperparameters into subsequent XGBoost, NB and RF models having numerous layers for identifying the normal and affected cases of breast cancer for which optimized hyper-parameter values of RF (Random Forest), NB (Naïve Bayes), and XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) are determined. This process helps in improvising the classification rate which is confirmed through analytical results.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.02.035","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608023001077","","","Breast cancer, Data Mining, Modified Scalable-Neighbourhood Component Analysis, Genetic-Hyper-Parameter Optimization","","0893-6080","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Three hundred and fifty video-learning records from 47,044 video viewing operations were obtained from 47 graduate students. Four learning improvement profiles were derived from a statistics course's pre- and post-test scores: the Advanced, the Diligent, the Indifferent, and the Persistent. The results indicated that the Diligent and the Persistent paused videos frequently. These students reflected the need with these self-paced breaks to take notes according to the retrospective interview. The Advanced demonstrated the highest SkippingBackward frequency with a small SkippingBackward time ratio, revealing confidence in searching the desired clips. In contrast, the Indifferent exhibited the least frequency but the largest time ratio for SkippingBackward, implying distraction problems. In addition, this study showed that the Pause time ratio was indirectly related to weekly quiz scores via autonomous motivation with marginal significance. Based on these results, we demonstrate that learning motivation can be revealed from dynamic clickstreams in video-based learning (i.e., the interaction between students and learning contexts), supporting its dynamic developmental mechanism. The authors suggest that instructors offer on-demand instructional materials and implement top-down video-viewing strategies or digital prompts to support and encourage autonomy in video-based learning.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104754","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131523000313","","",", , , , , ","","0360-1315","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Chapter 2 - The strength of digital transition in higher education as a success factor","Rui Brito Fonseca","","2023","ScienceDirect","13-24","","This accelerated societal transformation forced students, academic staff, academic organizations, and society in general to make a rapid transition to digital. In addition, the physical mobility of students, teachers, and nonteaching staff was replaced, in many cases, by digital mobility. Thus, new forms of virtual mobility were developed that continued to allow learning between people from institutions in different countries, preventing the breaking of healthy international academic ties. Likewise, conferences and other scientific meetings took place online. The high speed at which this digital transition is taking place has shown that we are facing a new world where communication and the individual are at the heart of the equation, allowing for economic, environmental, time, and reflection gains, among other factors. On the other hand, social and educational relationships are rapidly changing, acting on and reacting to the digital transition. Perhaps it is not incorrect to say that, socially and technologically, the 21st century just began, forced by the pandemic originated by SARS-CoV-2. Methodologically, this chapter presents a literature review of the digital transition, mainly in European higher education institutions, without forgetting experiences in other countries. To this end, it uses various official and scientific publications on the subject in question, complementing it with a broader reading, using articles from newspapers. This complementarity allows us to launch the discussion on how this complex subjects reaches the general population in 2021.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-15248-1.00015-1","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443152481000151","","","Education, Digital education, Health education, Higher education","Academic Press","","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Based on their personas, we then utilize deep reinforcement learning to search for appropriate grouping rules and perform linear programming to obtain a suitable grouping scheme. Finally, the teaching effectiveness is fed back as the rewards to the reinforcement learning model to optimize future grouping scheme selections. Extensive experiments conducted on MOOCs datasets show that PSG can achieve more advantageous performance in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to the manual or random grouping mechanism.

This research uses Syria as a case study to investigate the potential of a digital transformation strategy to revitalize the higher education system in war-ravaged regions. It proposes a digital transformation framework utilizing a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews, expert interviews, and case analysis, to identify critical challenges faced by Syrian higher education institutions. The framework focuses on developing digital infrastructure, capacity building for educators, e-learning platforms, digital content, and public-private partnerships that increase education access, foster collaboration, enable remote learning and enhance global competitiveness in war-torn areas. The e-learning platforms component explores the potential of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), Learning Management Systems (LMS), and blended learning approaches to enhance the quality and accessibility of higher education. The digital content component highlights the importance of open educational resources, digital libraries, and virtual labs to support learning. Finally, the capacity building component addresses the need for training and upskilling educators and administrators to implement digital solutions effectively. The proposed framework is a roadmap for policymakers, educators, and international organizations to develop and implement digital solutions supporting long-term recovery and growth in conflict-affected areas.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2023.100627","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291123002322","","","Digital transformation, Higher education, War-affected areas, Remote learning, International collaboration","","2590-2911","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

"Application of the convergent education model in the development of a smart learning environment","Mikhail Deev and Alexey Finogeev","Telematics and Informatics Reports","2023","ScienceDirect","100051","10","The article presents a scientific and practical approach to the development and implementation of the concept of convergent learning in the framework of building an open educational platform to manage the process of training specialists. The presented concept of convergence education is based on the integration of educational programs, learning content, competency matrices, methods and technologies for training specialists and personalized learning trajectories in smart learning environment. To implement the model and the convergent approach, it is vital to make use of an information and educational environment with mechanisms to support convergent learning based on regional labor market analysis, actualizing of educational programs and resources, harmonization and synchronization life-cycle models thereof, adaptive customization and personalization of specialist training trajectories. The article presents the developed convergence model of educational programs and employer vacancies as a weighted graph to illustrate the relationship between competence requirement vectors of educational programs and sought-after employment. To isolate the convergence model components and evaluate the convergence degree thereof, a graph clustering algorithm based on the Louvain method has been developed. A method for synthesizing a convergence model of educational content organized as a fuzzy weighted graph has been presented, and sets of topics and sections of electronic learning resources being its vertices.

"Recognition of EEG based on Improved Black Widow Algorithm optimized SVM","Qiuhao Huang and Chao Wang and Ye Ye and Lu Wang and Nenggang Xie","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","2023","ScienceDirect","104454","81","As a classifier suitable for nonlinear samples, support vector machines (SVM) is widely used in Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals pattern recognition. The performance of SVM depends mainly on the selection of model parameters. This paper modifies the reproductive formula of the Black Widow Optimization (BWO) algorithm to obtain an improved Black Widow Optimization (IBWO) algorithm, which solves the problem of the restricted search radius of the BWO algorithm. We construct an IBWO-SVM model in which IBWO is used to optimize the penalty parameter C and the kernel function parameter g of the SVM, and the optimized SVM model is applied to EEG signals classification. The effectiveness and superiority of IBWO-SVM is verified by using the BCI competition III dataset IVa EEG public dataset, and compared with the SVM optimized by the original BWO algorithm (BWO-SVM), the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA-SVM) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-SVM), The simulation results demonstrate that all indicators of the IBWO-SVM model are better than the three comparison models, in which the average classification accuracy on five subjects reaches 97.29%. In addition, the two-class motor imagery (left arm stretch and right fist clenched) EEG data collected from our experiment is also used to test the performance of the IBWO-SVM model. The average classification accuracy of the final twelve subjects is 5.21%, 4.16% and 1.47% higher than that of BWO-SVM, AFSA-SVM, and PSO-SVM, respectively. Therefore, the IBWO-SVM model can effectively improve the accuracy of EEG signals pattern recognition, which has a very important practical value.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2022.104454","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809422009089","","","Electroencephalogram (EEG), SVM, Parameter optimization, Improve Black Widow Optimization algorithm","","1746-8094","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Technological innovation and digital transformation can generate new momentum in high-quality education development by causing a major shift in educational paradigms and practice models. While the micro-level implementation of digital transformation on education has already been extensively discussed in the educational sector, the efforts in answering the same question from a macro-level perspective is currently lacking. The present study addresses this gap by discussing the implementation of digital transformation on education through the lens of diffusion of innovation theory. Specifically, we examine how the theory can provide unique insights on studying the developmental status, process, and outcome of digital transformation on education. As the application of diffusion of innovation theory in this topic, the study will contribute to the development of China's high-quality education system by providing theoretical guidance on the advancement of digital transformation on education under the overarching goal of education modernization.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.235","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923013935","","","Digital Transformation, Digital Learning, Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Bass Mode","","1877-0509","","27th International Conference on Knowledge Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Sytems (KES 2023)","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103677","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804523000966","","","Blockchain, 6G, Internet of things, Industry 4.0, Industrial IoT, 6G business model, Privacy and security","","1084-8045","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

Most of the existing efforts directly predict students’ performance depending on their dynamically changing knowledge states. However, the individualization of questions is neglected and difficulty level differ from question to question, which would give some valuable clues to KT. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Question Factors for Knowledge Tracing (MQFKT) method, which fully exploits various question factors to generate better prediction. On one hand, calibrated student-concept connection space is established to obtain fine-grained response representations on questions according to the information of responses on questions. On the other hand, individualized difficulty levels with particular concept for different questions are introduced for improving the prediction performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets have shown that the MQFKT approach achieves more precise prediction of student performance and better interpretation of the model.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119786","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423002877","","","Intelligent Education, Knowledge Tracing, Question Factors, Response Representation, Question Difficulty Level","","0957-4174","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

With the objective to assess the quality and adoptability of education supply chain, a novel analytical evaluation model approach is proposed, based on quality function deployment and combinative distance-based assessment. To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion. The results reveal that the three dominant suppliers, which provide the best response to the identified criteria, are providers of cloud service technology.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2022.122282","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162522008034","","","Digitalization of education, Education technology, Sustainable supplier selection, Multi-criteria decision-making, Combinative distance-based assessment","","0040-1625","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

"Semi-supervised and un-supervised clustering: A review and experimental evaluation","Kamal Taha","Information Systems","2023","ScienceDirect","102178","114","Retrieving, analyzing, and processing large data can be challenging. An effective and efficient mechanism for overcoming these challenges is to cluster the data into a compact and meaningful format that reflect the whole data. The learning techniques for clustering can be classified into supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Semi-supervised and un-supervised learning are more advantageous than supervised learning because it is laborious, and that prior knowledge is unavailable for most practical real-word problems. Towards this, we provide in this paper a review on semi-supervised and un-supervised learning methods. Unfortunately, most current survey papers categorize semi-supervised and un-supervised learning algorithms into broad clustering classes and do not drive clear boundaries between the specific techniques employed by the algorithms. That is, they do not set clear distinguishable boundaries between the specific techniques adopted by the algorithms. To overcome this, we provide a detailed methodology-based taxonomy that categorizes the algorithms into hierarchically nested, specific, and fine-grained classes. The taxonomy is hierarchically nested as follows: clustering categories → clustering methods → clustering sub-methods. First, the algorithms are classified into broad categories. In turn, each category is further classified into various methods. These methods are classified into sub-methods. We survey and describe over 200 state-of-the-art algorithms that employ the underlying principles of each clustering method/sub-method. We experimentally evaluate and rank the following: (1) the various clustering sub-methods that fall under a same clustering method, (2) the various clustering methods that fall under a same clustering category, (3) the various clustering categories.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2023.102178","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437923000145","","","Semi-supervised learning, Un-supervised learning, Clustering method, Clustering category","","0306-4379","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

As a result, interest in the Metaverse has grown considerably. Although educators may be aware of the Metaverse as a concept, its potential cannot be dismissed once it has been deployed. As the existence of the Metaverse is still in its infancy, it is crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding of its benefits, applications, and effects on the education system once it becomes an official part of the education experience in the current world.

In order to deal with this problem, Early Warning Systems (EWS) based on Machine Learning (ML) models are widely adopted in the literature as a solution to help teachers in their pedagogical monitoring. As the name implies, alert generation is intended to be the purpose of an EWS. However, the proposed systems don’t go beyond the early prediction of at-risk of failure learners and don’t suggest automatic methods to generate alerts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that automatically generates early and accurate alerts for teachers of at-risk of failure learners. This algorithm uses both an original concept of alert rule to define the alerting method and temporal evaluation metrics to identify the reliable starting time for generating alerts. As a proof of concept, we apply this algorithm on four different EWS using real data of k-12 learners enrolled in online learning courses.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32883-1_9","","","E-learning;Failure rate;Learning algorithms;","","03029743","English","Alert generation algorithm;Alert rule;Early Warning System;Failure rate;Generation algorithm;K-12 learner;Machine-learning;Online learning;Risk of failure;Teachers';","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

The paper guides educational games for medical surgery design and user experience theory and concepts. It shows how to capture the actual task’s and environment’s fundamental characteristics expressing realistic behaviors. It shows the significant issues (e.g., occlusion and the use of instruments) in capturing these tasks and possible options to overcome them (e.g., using video feeds from endoscopies and robotic surgery).

AI can offer personalized learning experiences, streamline administrative tasks, enhance feedback mechanisms, and provide robust data analysis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of AI on both student outcomes and teacher efficiency. However, caution must be exercised when implementing AI in education, considering potential risks and ethical dilemmas. It is essential to use AI as a tool to support human educators rather than replace them entirely. The adoption of AI in education holds the promise of creating more inclusive and effective learning environments, catering to students of diverse backgrounds and abilities. As AI technology continues to advance, the education sector can anticipate even more innovative applications, further shaping the future of learning.

Recent technological advances in the adjacent areas of natural language processing, machine learning, and computer graphics focusing primarily on design features that can improve their human-like qualities of naturalness and believability as human interlocutors have also amplified new application opportunities for Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) or Animated Pedagogical Agents (APAs) within the area of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL). Although AI-powered IVAs hold the potential to improve the learning process in nearly any knowledge domain and personalize automation in teaching by embodying different roles in the learning environment, strikingly few studies have empirically attempted to assess IVAs impact on L2 learners’ academic achievement when learning English as a Foreign (EFL) so far. The present article addresses this issue via a systematic review of relevant interventionist IVA studies that were conducted in EFL settings and published within the 2015–2020 timeframe examining IVAs key affordances, major barriers in their adoption for language learning purposes, and the CALL research trends currently prevalent on the topic.

Contrary to traditional teaching (classroom), distance learning is characterized by the lack of physical contact between instructors and students and also between students within a classroom. Unfortunately, some learners may fail or even stop learning online quite quickly. In addition, learners find it more difficult to learn, not because there is not enough content, but because there is too much and they cannot find what is useful and up-to-date. This study aims to prove the importance of using social and adaptive learning to overcome the problems that learners face in online learning platforms, we propose a model to determine the effects of using the two types of platforms in online learning, namely Learning Management System (LMS) and Learning Experience Platform (LXP) for two groups of learners in Moroccan higher education applying social learning analysis (SLA). Specifically, in this proposal we attempt to analyze data from the LMS and LXP platforms to build knowledge models about students and determine their learning styles based on their interactions on these platforms, improve their learning experience and predict the conditions that favor their progress and success in order to recreate the conditions for quality social learning and help learners find possible paths to success in the online learning platforms in Morocco.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32883-1_33","","","E-learning;Education computing;Learning systems;","","03029743","English","Condition;E - learning;Face to face;Learning analyse;Learning experience platform;Learning experiences;Learning management system;Learning platform;Online learning;Social learning;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"
"Knowledge Tracing Using Deep Learning Methods","Zaki, Ghodai Mohamed Abdelrahman Mohamed","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global","2023","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">This thesis aims to address a fundamental question relating to human and machine learning:Can a machine effectively trace the dynamics of a student’s knowledge states? The thesis assumes a generic definition for a student, which can be either a human learner or a machine learning model. This fundamental question lies at the heart of the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem, which has attracted increasing interest in recent years.Addressing the KT problem is essential for a variety of applications in education, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems. Generally speaking, a KT model targets to achieve two main objectives. First, it needs to find effective representations of a student’s knowledge states that can capture important learning concepts/skills in a learning course and their mutual relationships (e.g., prerequisite dependencies). Second, it aims to accurately trace temporal dynamics over a student’s knowledge state representations which are conditioned on performance observations from their past exercise answering activities. From a machine learning perspective, a KT model is usually performed through a supervised sequence prediction task. In such tasks, a KTmodel sequentially predicts the probabilities of correctly answering recently observed questions conditioned on the past exercise answering history, usually considering the relationships among questions and learning concepts in the learning subject. Solving this sequence prediction task involves a number of challenges, including modeling long and short-term dependencies in an exercise answering history, finding effective ways to leverage dependency relationships among exercises, and dealing with students’ forgetting behavior that may negatively impact their knowledge progress over time.To address these challenges, this thesis makes the following research contributions. First, we present a comprehensive literature review of research conducted on existing KT models and the relevant datasets and benchmarks used for model evaluation. Then, we address the challenge of modeling long-short term dependencies in exercise answering sequences by proposing a novel deep sequence learning model that can dynamically adjust its temporal attention to focus on relevant exercises for answer prediction. Following that, we consider the effect of a student’s forgetting behavior during knowledge state estimate through a novel forgetting-robust model that tracks forgetting features over learning concepts during the exercise sequence modeling. We highlight the potential of KT models in evolving effective teaching strategies through a novel reinforcement learning framework, which can leverage knowledge state representations to optimize a teacher agent interactively. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed models on well-established KT datasets. Furthermore, we propose a new KT dataset that addresses existing KT datasets’ limitations and make it publically available. Finally, we outline future research directions and possible application areas in the KTdomain.

As such, conversational tutoring agents have their place as an additional learning resource for students, especially when a need arises for a student to work through a learning scenario which would be difficult or dangerous to reproduce in real life. Such is the case with the training of caretakers for nursing homes and hospitals, needing to train nurse-patient interaction. In this work we present our approach to the development of a conversational agent intended to simulate a patient. The conversational agent is flexible enough to handle large number of possible conversations with the help of automatic story generation methods. This approach enables us to deploy new conversational agents with no need for manual writing of every possible storyline, while remaining compatible with available commercial off-the-shelf chatbot frameworks.

Some e-learning systems may be dialogue-based such as intelligent tutoring systems that teach math or social skills development simulators that teach skills such as negotiating or interview-taking. During the development of our prior work, a job interview training simulator, we encountered a lack of an authoring tool that we could use to develop interview scripts in a general file format. Hence, we developed an authoring tool as a web application, in which the dialogue flow is modelled as a directed graph. To build this graph-based interview script knowledge representation, we employed graph transformation or graph rewriting methods that would allow development of the script as a graph, stored in Java Script Object Notation. Although the tool is made to be compatible with our job interview training simulator, the interface and graph building API can be used with any job-interview simulator with a few modifications by a developer. To test the functionality of our authoring tool, we conducted a usability study with 6 participants. The results indicate acceptance of, and satisfaction with, the interface of the web-application, although enhancements in a few areas are needed for smooth user interaction. The back-end graph building API, on the other hand, performed successfully without any errors, and is ready for full integration with any job interview authoring tool interface.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-35129-7_30","","","Application programming interfaces (API);Application programs;Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Flow graphs;Graphic methods;Knowledge representation;","","03029743","English","Authoring tool;E-learning platforms;E-learning systems;Graph Transformation;Intelligent tutoring;Job interviews;Training simulator;Virtual job interview;WEB application;Web applications;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

A key element of an adaptive learning system is the recommendation system, which provides the most suitable resources based on learner profiles. Recommending the most appropriate learning resources to learners has always been a challenge in the field of e-learning. Thus, learners may have difficulties in choosing the appropriate material when faced with a large volume of recommended material during their learning process. This challenge led us to implement a chatbot to help learners improve their learning experience and knowledge. New solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The use of our chatbot integrated in Moodle, named LearningPartnerBot, provides learners a personalized recommendation of learning objects according to two strategies, one based on their knowledge level (KL) and the other based on their learning style (LS). The objective of this article is to compare the learning outcomes obtained after the realization of the two experiments based on these two approaches centered mainly on the use of the LearningPartnerBot. Consequently, the approach of recommending learning objects based on the knowledge level gave promising results by guaranteeing a more adapted learning to the learners.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32883-1_14","","","E-learning;Learning algorithms;Learning systems;Natural language processing systems;Recommender systems;","","03029743","English","Adaptive learning;Adaptive learning systems;Chatbots;Comparative experiments;Current status;E - learning;Key elements;Knowledge level;Learning object recommendation;Learning objects;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"
"Evaluating Text Summarization Using FAHP and TOPSIS Methods in Intelligent Tutoring Systems","Brajkovi, Emil and Vasi, Daniel and Volari, Tomislav","Communications in Computer and Information Science","2023","Engineering Village","1 - 17","1827 CCIS","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">The objective of this study is to suggest a fuzzy decision-making model that can help in choosing the most suitable text summarization technique for e-learning systems based on the subjective evaluations of decision makers. The criteria used for selecting the ideal text summarization method in this research are derived from the common features of the available text summarization techniques. Since there are multiple criteria involved in the assessment of text summarization techniques, multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) need to be employed. Our proposed method involves the use of the FAHP (fuzzy analytic hierarchy process) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methods. Initially, FAHP is used to calculate the weightage of each criterion, and the preference of one criterion over another is evaluated using triangular fuzzy numbers in the FAHP method. Then, the TOPSIS method is utilized to rank the text summarization techniques, and the one that is farthest from the negative ideal solution and closest to the positive ideal solution according to the TOPSIS method is considered the best method. The integration of FAHP and TOPSIS methods ensures an efficient selection of the most suitable text summarization method based on one’s requirements.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36833-2_1","","","Computer aided instruction;Fuzzy sets;Learning systems;Text processing;","","18650929","English","Fuzzy AHP;Fuzzy analytic hierarchy;Fuzzy Decision making;Ideal solutions;Intelligent tutoring;Multicriteria decision making methods;Solution methods;Technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution;Text Summarisation;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"
"Sim-GAIL: A generative adversarial imitation learning approach of student modelling for intelligent tutoring systems","Li, Zhaoxing and Shi, Lei and Wang, Jindi and Cristea, Alexandra I. and Zhou, Yunzhan","Neural Computing and Applications","2023","Engineering Village","24369 - 24388","35","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">The continuous application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in online education has led to significant progress, especially in the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), online courses and learning management systems (LMS). An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students’ learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students’ learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students’ behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model’s prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s).","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-08989-w","","","Computer aided instruction;Education computing;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;Online systems;Reinforcement learning;Students;","","09410643","English","Cold-start;Generative adversarial imitation learning;Imitation learning;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning trajectories;Model method;Student Modeling;Training data;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

"Analysis of Emerging Trends in Artificial Intelligence in Education in Nigeria","Bali, Bulus","Research Square","2023","Engineering Village","","","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In the domain of education, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift towards a more technologically-driven landscape, demonstrating its efficacy as an emergency strategy. The pervasive influence of computer technology has catalyzed a surge in online learning within the country, yielding positive educational outcomes. Despite these advancements, a considerable number of educational institutions in Nigeria have yet to leverage AI technologies. Recognizing the expanding significance of AI in education, this study seeks to align with this trajectory by aggregating instances of AI implementation in education from developed countries. The methodology employed involves a comprehensive review of current advancements in AI applications within the Nigerian educational context. The review process, spanning papers retrieved from four digital libraries published between 2008 and 2022, culminated in the inclusion of 73 papers. These selected papers demonstrated the utilization of AI software tools and technologies, adhering to predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria. The findings of the study reveal a prevalent use of AI technologies in education in Nigeria, encompassing evolutionary software modelling, student performance prediction, multimedia e-learning platforms and frameworks, and the incorporation of Moodle learning. This discernible trend indicates a growing demand for the application of AI technology in the educational landscape of Nigeria. However, the study also highlights a discrepancy wherein more sophisticated AI techniques, such as intelligent tutoring systems, learnable robots or agents, web-based educational systems, and learning management systems explored extensively in other nations were infrequently applied in the Nigerian context. In light of these observations, the study proposes that educational institutions in Nigeria should consider adopting AI practices from more advanced nations. This strategic alignment is posited as a means to augment student learning opportunities and bridge the existing gap between the current state of AI integration in Nigerian education and the more advanced applications witnessed globally.<br/></div> © 2023, CC BY.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3819828/v1","","","Computer aided instruction;Digital libraries;Engineering education;Intelligent robots;Learning systems;Students;","","","English","'current;Artificial intelligence in education;Artificial intelligence technologies;E - learning;Educational institutions;Nigeria;Nigerians;Teaching and learning;Trend analysis;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

To this end, AI is used in varying techniques to automate sophisticated functions in UX and thereby changing what UX is apprehended by the users. This is achieved through the development of intelligent interactive systems such as virtual assistants, recommender systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The changes are well received, as technological achievements but create new challenges of trust, explainability and usability to humans, which in turn need to be amended by further advancements of AI in reciprocity. AI can be utilised to enhance the UX of a system while the quality of the UX can influence the effectiveness of AI. The state of the art in AI for UX is constantly evolving, with a growing focus on designing transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that prioritise user control and autonomy, protect user data privacy and security, and promote diversity and inclusivity in the design process. Staying up to date with the latest advancements and best practices in this field is crucial. This paper conducts a critical analysis of published academic works and research studies related to AI and UX, exploring their interrelationship and the cause-effect cycle between the two. Ultimately, best practices for achieving a successful interrelationship of AI in UX are identified and listed based on established methods or techniques that have been proven to be effective in previous research reviewed.<br/></div> © 2023 - The authors.

One type of software aimed at providing a more engaging and educational experience is the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). The ITS system featured in this research is called FAIE, which focuses on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning. The blueprint-based approach allows educators to design content for students, but this raises two challenges. First, designing the content requires technical skills that can be time-consuming for educators with many tasks. Second, it is difficult to immediately codify an educator’s intrinsic knowledge. To tackle these challenges, a Blueprint-designer was created to generate content based on a text prompt from the educator containing key information.

"Onlife Education: Beyond Distance Learning by Intelligent Tutoring Systems","Distefano, Salvatore","Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","2023","Engineering Village","355 - 365","354 SIST","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">In the pandemic scenario, characterized by lockdowns and service interruptions, Distance Learning allowed educational pathways remotely, proving to be a reliable solution, resilient to the emergency. However, issues related to its effectiveness as well as social and psychological implications, remain unresolved. From many sides, there is a desire to go beyond DL, towards a more engaging and efficient experience that takes advantage of the limitless knowledge resources offered by the infosphere. This new type of DL or DL 2.0 integrates different educational modes, beyond the blended approach, following the path of onlife education, without distinction between online and offline. In this context, tools such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) could prove to be useful and effective as a complement to DL, a significant step towards onlife learning. In this paper, an ITS solution that led to the implementation of Virtual Study Buddy is proposed, primarily designed to support students in their individual studies, acting as a digital learning assistant. Virtual Study Buddy brings together concepts of machine learning and gamification with cloud technologies, leveraging personal and mobile devices, and can integrate with traditional DL processes for a new and more complete form of onlife learning.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-3068-5_33","","","Computer aided instruction;Education computing;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;","","21903018","English","Cloud-computing;Distance-learning;Gamification;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Machine-learning;Onlife learning;Phygital;Tutoring system;Virtual studies;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Many ITS provide standardized analytical methods to evaluate classroom performance or the results of the exercises. But they lack more sophisticated, flexible and individual analyses. This paper presents an e-learning Analytics Tool (EAT) for an ITS that provides a dashboard with key figures and a flexible analytics board (FAB). This enables lecturers to analyze students’ performance in detail and identify misconceptions. For instance, the FAB allows us to classify student solutions, reveal conceptual errors in exercises, and analyze each part of an exercise. By this, common mistakes can be identified, and tailored feedback can be given to the students. Following the design science approach, the platform is designed in a general way so that it can be used for different types of exercises (e.g., Math, Excel, SQL). To assess the artifact, we conducted group interviews with German University lecturers from various courses. The results show that lecturers require a good overview of the submitted student solutions to provide timely feedback. They also appreciate the flexible analytics tool for detailed analyses of student solutions to understand student mistakes better. The employed architecture allows general analyses of exercises and the content of students’ solutions. In addition, the EAT is not bound to a specific kind of exercise, but can cope with different kinds like SQL and Excel.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32808-4_21","","","Computer aided instruction;Education computing;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Learning systems;","","03029743","English","Analytic tools;Dashboard;Flexible analyse;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Learning analytic and evaluation;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

"Improving Knowledge Tracing via Considering Two Types of Actual Differences From Exercises and Prior Knowledge","Mao, Shun and Zhan, Jieyu and Wang, Yizhao and Jiang, Yuncheng","IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","2023","Engineering Village","324 - 338","16","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">For offering adaptive learning to learners in intelligent tutoring systems, one of the fundamental tasks is knowledge tracing (KT), which aims to assess learners' learning states and make prediction for future performance. However, there are two crucial issues in deep learning-based KT models. First, the knowledge concepts are used to predict learners' performance instead of exercises. This choice ignores the actual difference among exercises, which leads to the KT model's inability to explore the rich information at the exercise level, thus, weakening the KT model's performance. Second, the actual difference in prior knowledge is neglected. Therefore, in-depth research of these two types of the actual differences offers the possibility to improve the prediction performance of KT further. To this end, we propose a fine-grained knowledge tracing model (FGKT)1 to capture these two types of actual differences. We first obtain the exercise representations by considering the corresponding knowledge concepts and actual difference among exercises. Then, an effective attention mechanism is designed to capture the relevance between assessment exercises and historical interactions to acquire individual prior knowledge. Finally, we evaluate the proposed FGKT model on several available benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our model surpasses benchmark KT models by up to 7% in prediction performance on the latest ASSISTments dataset.<br/></div> © 2008-2011 IEEE.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2023.3259013","","","Benchmarking;Computer aided instruction;Deep learning;Forecasting;Job analysis;Probabilistic logics;","","19391382","English","Adaptive learning;Attention mechanisms;Computational modelling;Hidden-Markov models;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Knowledge tracings;Personalized e-learning;Predictive models;Task analysis;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

As a consequence, many preposition errors in writing can be attributed to a direct transfer from a writer’s native language. While research in scalable tooling for second-language writing assistance has largely focused on automated error detection and correction, relatively little attention has been given to explaining why the errors may have occurred. A system that can distinguish interlingual errors – arising from an over-literal translation from a writer’s native language – from non-interlingual errors could serve as an insightful tool for language learners and teachers alike. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying English preposition errors produced by native speakers of Spanish as interlingual. We propose a corpus-based method that exploits translation probabilities to estimate the likelihood that a writer has translated word-for-word from Spanish to English. We then show that this method correlates well with human judgments on the interlingual status of preposition errors and can be a basis for developing a tool for explaining one key source of errors in second-language writing.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32883-1_10","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Learning systems;Linguistics;Translation (languages);","","03029743","English","Computer assisted language learning;Direct transfer;Error detection and correction;ESL;Grammatical error detections;Language learning;Native language;Preposition error;Second language;Second language learning;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Language proficiency is a key component of comprehending a question’s text and is known to be closely related to students’ academic performance. In this study, language proficiency was defined with Elo rating score and time window features, and was used in the knowledge tracing task. The dataset used in this study contains 54,470 students and 7,619,040 interactions, which were collected from a real-world online-learning platform. We conducted a correlation analysis to determine whether the language proficiency information of students was related to their ability to solve math word problems. In addition, we examined the effect of incorporating the language proficiency information on the knowledge tracing models using various baseline models. The analysis revealed a high correlation between the length of word problems and students’ language proficiency. Furthermore, in experiments with various baseline models, utilizing the language proficiency information improved the knowledge tracing model’s performance.

However, engagement in mobile AR environments mainly relies on users' computer skills, which vary among users and impact their ability to utilize this technology. This research addresses this gap in understanding the influence of users' computer skills on interactions in mobile AR. In view of the above, this paper presents a fuzzy logic-based model to assess and refine users' computer skills in the context of mobile AR systems. Modelling the users' computer skills, the system is responsible for providing personalized assistive messages and feedback. These messages are designed to align with the fuzzy weights that have been established, enhancing users' interactions within the mobile AR environment. The presented approach is integrated in a personalized mobile AR system for spatial ability training. The evaluation results demonstrate a highly positive outlook. A major conclusion of this work is that fuzzy logic modelling has significant potential to enhance user experiences and drive advancements in mobile augmented reality technology.

To overcome this issue which could probably be due to students’ lack of engagement, motivation and problem-solving skills, the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can be an effective tool for enhancing student learning. Despite its effectiveness, no prior research has been conducted on the impact of using ITS in higher education institutions in Oman. This study therefore investigates the perceptions of Omani University instructors to determine the levels of awareness, readiness and challenges among Omani higher institutions concerning their integration of ITS. Also, to investigate the reasons for the poor achievement of students in programming courses. We adopted two approaches in this study. First, quantitative research was conducted via a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire distributed to 59 programming instructors from different higher education institutions. Second, quantitative research interviewed 10 instructors. Our questionnaire data reveals that most of the participants are aware of ITS’ effectiveness in the learning process. They believe that Oman’s higher education institutions are ready to adopt ITS if sufficient training and support is provided. Via text mining, our interview data illustrates the reasons behind poor performance in programming courses which includes English language barriers, deficient critical thinking, lack problem-solving skills and inadequate modes of teaching.

The majority of programming research has been on student challenges and mistakes that compromise technical accuracy [2]. Prior study has shown that debugging approaches are utilized to create response in learning coding [3]. The goal of this paper is to build a web-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) application for freshmen learning C language that predicts tinkering activity using constraint-based modeling (CBM) and machine learning algorithm. The system was created for capturing C code samples focused on assignment statements, which would then be sent to the tutor model for submitted code assessment and response generation using CBM. This paper expanded the first system prototype of Arguson et al. [4] which was pilot tested on 2 synchronous coding classes among 31 freshman tertiary students composed of 9 BS Computer Science and 22 BS Information Technology respondents. The dataset was taken from the aforementioned first prototype, whilst the student model was built using the data science approach for building the student model. Arguson et al. [5]'s study was used to construct a modified CBM that centers on assignment statements. The model statistically predicted tinkering on both numerical value problems and incorrect expressions performed by beginner programmers, according to the results. In the development of the final ITS prototype, a novel detection of tinkering activity in the context of C coding focused on assignment statements was deployed. Adhering to Scrum framework, the authors were able to supervise the software project in this study. It emerged that tinkering activity can be predicted using compiled inexperienced C programming logs as well as tailored-fit feedback is required to comprehend the aforementioned programming language. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","10.1109/HNICEM60674.2023.10589157","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199865297&doi=10.1109%2fHNICEM60674.2023.10589157&partnerID=40&md5=cba5fc606004f7e8e3399510bf5e2e90","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"

Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose dynamic cognitive diagnosis, which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience. Moreover, educational priors also improve the accuracy of student performance prediction.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Article","10.1109/TLT.2023.3254544","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149847549&doi=10.1109%2fTLT.2023.3254544&partnerID=40&md5=9c55d621e1cad4e189401593ca057970","","","","","","","Cited by: 8","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"

This is particularly the case for computer science, as a tutoring domain, which is rapidly growing and changing and as such, learners need frequent update courses. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a fuzzy-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS), that teaches computer programming. The evaluation concerns multiple aspects of the ITS. The evaluation criteria are: (i) context, (ii) effectiveness, (iii) efficiency, (iv) accuracy, (v) usability and satisfaction, and (vi) engagement and motivation. In the evaluation process students of an undergraduate program in Informatics of the University of Piraeus in Greece participated. The evaluation method that was used included questionnaires, analysis of log files and experiments. Also, t-tests were conducted to certify the validity of the evaluation results. Indeed, the evaluation results are very positive and show that the incorporated fuzzy mechanism to the presented ITS enhances the system with Artificial Intelligence and through this, it increases the learners’ satisfaction and new knowledge learning and mastering, improves the recommendation accuracy of the system, the efficacy of interactions, and contributes positively to the learners’ engagement in the learning process. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","10.1007/s10639-022-11444-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142199684&doi=10.1007%2fs10639-022-11444-3&partnerID=40&md5=744c72484296bb721f642c341b43199e","","","","","","","Cited by: 12; All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"
"State-Aware Deep Item Response Theory using student facial features","Zhou, Yan and Suzuki, Kenji and Kumano, Shiro","Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","2023","Scopus","","6","This paper introduces a novel approach to Item Response Theory (IRT) by incorporating deep learning to analyze student facial expressions to enhance the prediction and understanding of student responses to test items. This research is based on the assertion that students' facial expressions offer crucial insights into their cognitive and affective states during testing, subsequently influencing their item responses. The proposed State-Aware Deep Item Response Theory (SAD-IRT) model introduces a new parameter, the student state parameter, which can be viewed as a relative subjective difficulty parameter. It is latent-regressed from students' facial features while solving test items using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In an experiment with 20 students, SAD-IRT boosted prediction performance in students' responses compared to prior models without the student state parameter, including standard IRT and its deep neural network implementation, while maintaining consistent predictions of student ability and item difficulty parameters. The research further illustrates the model's early prediction ability in predicting the student's response result before the student answered. This study holds substantial implications for educational assessment, laying the groundwork for more personalized and effective learning and assessment strategies that consider students' emotional and cognitive states.

For this, the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) is used, which is based on the Index of Learning Style (ILS) questionnaire. The idea is to use the answers to the questionnaire as provided by a student - as the input of the OOBN model to classify the learning style of this student. The classifications made by the OOBN model are validated with the full questionnaire with 44 questions as well as a short version with only 20 questions. The results of the OOBN classification with 44 individually answered questions represent the ground truth to compare the classifier performance in case a reduced set of questions is used. The OOBN with 20 questions suggest that the approach is classifying the students into the correct learning style dimensions in most cases.

In this study, we produce and evaluate the first machine-learned predictions of student course load ratings and generalize our model to the full 10,000 course catalog of a large public university. We then retrospectively analyze longitudinal differences in the semester load of student course selections throughout their degree. CLA by semester shows that a student’s first semester at the university is among their highest load semesters, as opposed to a credit hour-based analysis, which would indicate it is among their lowest. Investigating what role predicted course load may play in program retention, we find that students who maintain a semester load that is low as measured by credit hours but high as measured by CLA are more likely to leave their program of study. This discrepancy in course load is particularly pertinent in STEM and associated with high prerequisite courses. Our findings have implications for academic advising, institutional handling of the freshman experience, and student-facing analytics to help students better plan, anticipate, and prepare for their selected courses.","","10.1145/3576050.3576081","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3576050.3576081","","","course load analytics, higher education, on-time graduation, stop-out, workload","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"

Interact.","2023","ACM Digital Library","","7","Modeling users' experience in gameful systems is one of the main contemporary challenges in the field of human-computer interaction. One of the most desired and complex experiences to be identified is the flow experience (i.e., challenge-skill balance, action-awareness merging, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, concentration, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time, and autotelic experience). Facing this challenge, we conducted a quantitative study (N = 313) based on structural equation modeling, aiming to model and predict the users' flow experience through their behavior (represented by performance-related, interaction with gamification, as well as the time they take in different actions) in the system. The main results indicate that i) gamification (i.e., doing well in points, badges, and leader-board) was positively related to users' experience of good challenge-skill balance, ii) whereas it was negatively related to users' concentration. Thirdly iii) user performance was positively related to users' concentration. However, overall, the results indicate that while associations between user behavior and flow experience could be established, there remains future work to be done to fully explain user flow experience while using a system. Our study contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, gamification, and educational technologies, especially through insights related to modeling and predicting flow experiences in gameful systems through behavior data.","","10.1145/3611032","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3611032","","","User experience, data-driven study, flow experience, gameful systems, gamification","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"

However, the vast exercise resource and the varying learning abilities of individual students pose a significant challenge in selecting appropriate exercise questions. Collaborative filtering-based methods often struggle with recommending suitable exercises, while deep learning-based methods lack explanation, limiting their practical adoption. To address these limitations, this paper proposes KG4Ex, a knowledge graph-based exercise recommendation method. KG4Ex facilitates the matching of diverse students with suitable exercises while providing recommendation reasons. Specifically, we introduce a feature extraction module to represent students' learning states and construct a knowledge graph for exercise recommendation. This knowledge graph comprises three key entities (knowledge concepts, students, and exercises) and their interrelationships, and can be used to recommend suitable exercises. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and expert interviews demonstrate the superiority of KG4Ex over existing baseline methods and highlight its strong explainability.","","10.1145/3583780.3614943","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3583780.3614943","","","long short-term memory, knowledge graph, exercise recommendation","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"

In this work, we recognize the incorrect answers caused by these buggy processes as Common Wrong Answers (CWAs). We examine the ability of teachers and instructional designers to identify CWAs proactively. As teachers and instructional designers deeply understand the common approaches and mistakes students make when solving mathematical problems, we examine the feasibility of proactively identifying CWAs and generating Common Wrong Answer Feedback (CWAFs) as a formative feedback intervention for addressing student learning needs. As such, we analyze CWAFs in three sets of analyses. We first report on the accuracy of the CWAs predicted by the teachers and instructional designers on the problems across two activities.

"Adversarial Bootstrapped Question Representation Learning for Knowledge Tracing","Sun, Jianwen and Yu, Fenghua and Liu, Sannyuya and Luo, Yawei and Liang, Ruxia and Shen, Xiaoxuan","","2023","ACM Digital Library","8016–8025","","Knowledge tracing (KT), which estimates and traces the degree of learners' mastery of concepts based on students' responses to learning resources, has become an increasingly relevant problem in intelligent education. The accuracy of predictions greatly depends on the quality of question representations. While contrastive learning has been commonly used to generate high-quality representations, the selection of positive and negative samples for knowledge tracing remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial bootstrapped question representation (ABQR) model, which can generate robust and high-quality question representations without requiring negative samples. Specifically, ABQR introduces the bootstrap self-supervised learning framework, which learns question representations from different views of the skill-informed question interaction graph and facilitates question representations between each view to predict one another, thereby circumventing the need for negative sample selection. Moreover, we propose a multi-objective multi-round feature adversarial graph augmentation method to obtain a higher-quality target view, while preserving the structural information of the original graph. ABQR is versatile and can be easily integrated with any base KT model as a plug-in to enhance the quality of question representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABQR significantly improves the performance of the base KT model and outperforms state-of-the-art models. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each module of ABQR.

Asian Low-Resour. Lang. Inf. Process.","2023","ACM Digital Library","","22","Learning Disabilities (LD) can be categorized into logical, analytical, grammatical, vocabulary, sequential, and inference disabilities. Analysis of such disabilities assists students to identify and strengthen their weak areas. A wide variety of analysis models is proposed by researchers to perform such tasks, but most of these models are highly complex and cannot be scaled for multimodal parameter sets. To overcome these issues, this text proposes a model for correlative assessment of differential usage patterns in students with-or-without learning disabilities via multimodal analysis. The proposed model initially collects real-time inference sets for students with Learning Disabilities (LD) and without LDs. These sets consist of question-specific recorded responses for “Addition,” “Carry Propagation,” “Basic to Advanced Grammar,” “Direct, Inference and Vocabulary Comprehension,” “Finding odd-man-out,” “Sequencing,” and “Pseudo and Sight Spelling” for different question sets. Answers to these questions and their metadata were processed via a correlative engine that assisted in evaluation of correctness, time needed per question per category, number of skips, number of revisits, and unanswered ratio for different students. This evaluation was combined with temporal analysis to identify per-category progress of students. Based on this progress, students were either upgraded to next level or given lower-level questions, which assisted them to incrementally improve their grades. The model proved that the performance of LD students is 55\% less than the non-LD students and an average of 18 LD students have achieved an average of 33\% of improvement after having multiple attempts of the adaptive lessons. The model uses a correlation function, which enables to identify answering patterns of LD and non-LD students with 98.4\% accuracy, thus can be used for clinical scenarios.","","10.1145/3632365","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3632365","","","multimodal analysis, multiple attempt analysis, correlation analysis, Learning disability","Association for Computing Machinery","2375-4699","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"
"Forgetting-aware Linear Bias for Attentive Knowledge Tracing","Im, Yoonjin and Choi, Eunseong and Kook, Heejin and Lee, Jongwuk","","2023","ACM Digital Library","3958–3962","","Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to track proficiency based on a question-solving history, allowing us to offer a streamlined curriculum. Recent studies actively utilize attention-based mechanisms to capture the correlation between questions and combine it with the learner's characteristics for responses. However, our empirical study shows that existing attention-based KT models neglect the learner's forgetting behavior, especially as the interaction history becomes longer. This problem arises from the bias that overprioritizes the correlation of questions while inadvertently ignoring the impact of forgetting behavior. This paper proposes a simple-yet-effective solution, namely Forgetting-aware Linear Bias (FoLiBi), to reflect forgetting behavior as a linear bias. Despite its simplicity, FoLiBi is readily equipped with existing attentive KT models by effectively decomposing question correlations with forgetting behavior. FoLiBi plugged with several KT models yields a consistent improvement of up to 2.58\% in AUC over state-of-the-art KT models on four benchmark datasets.","","10.1145/3583780.3615191","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3583780.3615191","","","knowledge tracing, forgetting behavior, attention mechanism","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.956261574","Rejected"

Previous research in music education has suggested that using visualization or imagery as a training method, so-called audiation, helps novice learners gain a better understanding of the relationship between sound and embouchure. Inspired by this concept, we designed an interactive learning system using real-time acoustic analysis (MFCCs) and support vector machines (SVM). Our interactive visualization aims to support the user’s learning process by rendering the quality of good and bad sounds as pitch indications through particle swarm animations. A pilot user study showed that this makes the learning experience more reflective and self-directed, as the learner can understand the relationship between their breathing technique and the visualization of the generated sound quality.

This paper presents an exploration into the role of nation-level metrics of culture, happiness, wealth, and size on the generalizability of completion prediction models across countries. The findings indicate that various dimensions of culture are predictive of cross-country model generalizability.

Although many technical efforts have been devoted to modeling students based on their question-response sequences, fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs within each sequence is underexplored. This causes question-response representations less contextualized and further limits student modeling. To address this issue, we first conduct a data analysis and reveal the existence of complex cross effects between different question-response pairs within a sequence. Consequently, we propose MRT-KT, a multi-relational transformer for knowledge tracing, to enable fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs.

In these systems, students can practice independently and learn from different learning materials over long periods of time. As a result, it is essential to trace students' knowledge states over long learning sequences while maintaining a personalized model of each individual student's progress. However, the existing deep learning-based knowledge tracing models are either not personalized or not tailored for handling long sequences. Handling long sequences are especially essential in the online education environments, in where models are preferred to be updated with the newly collected user data in a timely manner as students could acquire knowledge on each learning activity. In this paper, we propose a knowledge tracing model, Continuous Personalized Knowledge Tracing (CPKT), that can mimic the real-world long-term continuous learning scenario by incorporating a novel online model training paradigm that is suitable for the knowledge tracing problem. To achieve personalized knowledge tracing, we propose two model components: 1) personalized memory slots to maintain learner's knowledge in a lifelong manner, and 2) personalized user embeddings that help to accurately predict the individual responses, correctly detect the personalized knowledge acquisition and forgetting patterns, and better interpret and analyze the learner's progress.

"Instruction-Embedded Assessment for Reading Ability in Adaptive Mathematics Software","Almoubayyed, Husni and Fancsali, Stephen E. and Ritter, Steve","","2023","ACM Digital Library","366–377","","Adaptive educational software is likely to better support broader and more diverse sets of learners by considering more comprehensive views (or models) of such learners. For example, recent work proposed making inferences about “non-math” factors like reading comprehension while students used adaptive software for mathematics to better support and adapt to learners. We build on this proposed approach to more comprehensive learning modeling by providing an empirical basis for making inferences about students’ reading ability from their performance on activities in adaptive software for mathematics. We lay out an approach to predicting middle school students’ reading ability using their performance on activities within Carnegie Learning’s MATHia, a widely used intelligent tutoring system for mathematics. We focus on how performance in an early, introductory activity as an especially powerful place to consider instruction-embedded assessment of non-math factors like reading comprehension to guide adaptation based on factors like reading ability. We close by discussing opportunities to extend this work by focusing on particular knowledge components or skills tracked by MATHia that may provide important “levers” for driving adaptation based on students’ reading ability while they learn and practice mathematics.","","10.1145/3576050.3576105","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3576050.3576105","","","assessments, intelligent tutoring systems, machine learning, predictive modeling","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"
"Evaluating the usage of Text-To-Speech in K12 education","Dai, Laduona and Kritskaia, Veronika and van der Velden, Evelien and Jung, Merel M. and Postma, Marie and Louwerse, Max M.","","2023","ACM Digital Library","182–188","","With increased interest in the use of virtual avatars for educational purposes, there is a growing need for high-quality text-to-speech solutions. However, the effects of using synthesized speech in educational applications for younger listeners are still unclear as past findings have been inconsistent and most of them have been obtained in a lab setting with adult assessors. Next to that, it is unclear how much training material is needed for high quality speech synthesis. Particularly for low resource languages, the assumption that good quality synthesized speech requires substantial amounts of vocal recordings to train may be hindering the development of TTS-based solutions. In this study, we created four Dutch text-to-speech (TTS) models from different amounts of training material and evaluated the models in terms of voice perception and recall with K12 students in a classroom environment. Results showed that while the original human voice outperformed the synthesized voices in terms of the listening experience and knowledge test score, more hours of training material did not necessarily result in better outcomes suggesting that 10-15 hours of speech material might be sufficient for training a Dutch TTS. A weak positive correlation was found between listening experience and knowledge test performance, with the low listening effort being the most important factor. This outcome suggests that comprehensibility is likely the most important TTS feature for educational applications.","","10.1145/3578837.3578864","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3578837.3578864","","","Text-to-speech, K12 education","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"

We aim to analyze the essential techniques and critical educational problems studied by researchers in five AIED-related conferences and journals between 2010 and 2022. We trained and compared different machine learning models and feature extraction techniques to achieve the research objective. After comparing different models and hyperparameter combinations, our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen's kappa of 0.80. Based on the classification results, we identified the top 10 most frequent keywords within each category for every four year period over the past 12 years. Using the classifier, the 10,723 keywords from 2,684 articles were classified into three categories: educational foci, technical solutions, and AIED applications. We find that 'natural language processing' and 'machine learning' are the primary technical keywords in AIED research, and 'deep learning' and 'artificial intelligence' are the trending technical keywords since 2017. Meanwhile, 'massive open online courses', 'self-regulated learning', 'feedback', 'collaborative learning', and 'online learning' are the top educational foci in the field over the last 12 years. 'Intelligent tutoring systems', 'educational data mining', 'knowledge tracing', and 'learning analytics' continue to receive attention as AIED applications of sustained interest.

Inf. Syst.","2023","ACM Digital Library","","42","Graph embedding (GE) aims to acquire low-dimensional node representations while maintaining the graph’s structural and semantic attributes. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) signify a noteworthy achievement in the fusion of AI and education. Utilizing GE to model ITS can elevate their performance in predictive and annotation tasks. Current GE techniques, whether applied to heterogeneous or dynamic graphs, struggle to efficiently model ITS data. The GEs within ITS should retain their semidynamic, independent, and smooth characteristics. This article introduces a heterogeneous evolution network (HEN) for illustrating entities and relations within an ITS. Additionally, we introduce a temporal extension graph neural network (TEGNN) to model both evolving and static nodes within the HEN. In the TEGNN framework, dynamic nodes are initially improved over time through temporal extension (TE), providing an accurate depiction of each learner’s implicit state at each time step. Subsequently, we propose a stochastic temporal pooling (STP) strategy to estimate the embedding sets of all evolving nodes. This effectively enhances model efficiency and usability. Following this, a heterogeneous aggregation network is devised to proficiently extract heterogeneous features from the HEN. This network employs both node-level and relation-level attention mechanisms to craft aggregated node features. To emphasize the superiority of TEGNN, we perform experiments on several real ITS datasets and show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments validate that TE serves as an efficient framework for modeling temporal information in GE, and STP not only accelerates the training process but also enhances the resultant accuracy.","","10.1145/3617828","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3617828","","","dynamic graph, heterogeneous information network, graph embedding, knowledge tracing, Intelligent education","Association for Computing Machinery","1046-8188","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"
"HOPE: Human-Centric Off-Policy Evaluation for E-Learning and Healthcare","Gao, Ge and Ju, Song and Ausin, Markel Sanz and Chi, Min","","2023","ACM Digital Library","1504–1513","","Reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively researched for enhancing human-environment interactions in various human-centric tasks, including e-learning and healthcare. Since deploying and evaluating policies online are high-stakes in such tasks, off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for inducing effective policies. In human-centric environments, however, OPE is challenging because the underlying state is often unobservable, while only aggregate rewards can be observed (students' test scores or whether a patient is released from the hospital eventually). In this work, we propose a human-centric OPE (HOPE) to handle partial observability and aggregated rewards in such environments. Specifically, we reconstruct immediate rewards from the aggregated rewards considering partial observability to estimate expected total returns. We provide a theoretical bound for the proposed method, and we have conducted extensive experiments in real-world human-centric tasks, including sepsis treatments and an intelligent tutoring system. Our approach reliably predicts the returns of different policies and outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks using both standard validation methods and human-centric significance tests.","","","","","","POMDP, aggregated rewards, e-learning, healthcare, human-centric environments, off-policy evaluation, reinforcement learning","International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems","","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"

"Towards Educator-Driven Tutor Authoring: Generative AI Approaches for Creating Intelligent Tutor Interfaces","Calo, Tommaso and Maclellan, Christopher","","2024","ACM Digital Library","305–309","","Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have shown great potential in delivering personalized and adaptive education, but their widespread adoption has been hindered by the need for specialized programming and design skills. Existing approaches overcome the programming limitations with no-code authoring through drag and drop, however they assume that educators possess the necessary skills to design effective and engaging tutor interfaces. To address this assumption we introduce generative AI capabilities to assist educators in creating tutor interfaces that meet their needs while adhering to design principles. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to generate tutor layout and contents based on high-level requirements provided by educators as inputs. However, to allow them to actively participate in the design process, rather than relying entirely on AI-generated solutions, we allow generation both at the entire interface level and at the individual component level. The former provides educators with a complete interface that can be refined using direct manipulation, while the latter offers the ability to create specific elements to be added to the tutor interface. A small-scale comparison shows the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of tutor interface design. Moving forward, we raise critical questions for assisting educators with generative AI capabilities to create personalized, effective, and engaging tutors, ultimately enhancing their adoption.","","10.1145/3657604.3664694","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3657604.3664694","","","human-centered computing, intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent-user-interfaces, ui/ux","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45631.553634259","Accepted"
"Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms","Ahmed, Esmael","Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing","2024","Scopus","","2024","Education is crucial for a productive life and providing necessary resources. With the advent of technology like artificial intelligence, higher education institutions are incorporating technology into traditional teaching methods. Predicting academic success has gained interest in education as a strong academic record improves a university's ranking and increases student employment opportunities. Modern learning institutions face challenges in analyzing performance, providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating students' performance, and identifying future needs. E-learning is a rapidly growing and advanced form of education, where students enroll in online courses. Platforms like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), learning management systems (LMS), and massive open online courses (MOOC) use educational data mining (EDM) to develop automatic grading systems, recommenders, and adaptative systems. However, e-learning is still considered a challenging learning environment due to the lack of direct interaction between students and course instructors. Machine learning (ML) is used in developing adaptive intelligent systems that can perform complex tasks beyond human abilities. Some areas of applications of ML algorithms include cluster analysis, pattern recognition, image processing, natural language processing, and medical diagnostics. In this research work, K-means, a clustering data mining technique using Davies' Bouldin method, obtains clusters to find important features affecting students' performance. The study found that the SVM algorithm had the best prediction results after parameter adjustment, with a 96% accuracy rate. In this paper, the researchers have examined the functions of the Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. The outcomes of parameter adjustment greatly increased the accuracy of the four prediction models. Naïve Bayes model's prediction accuracy is the lowest when compared to other prediction methods, as it assumes a strong independent relationship between features.  © 2024 Esmael Ahmed.","Article","10.1155/2024/4067721","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193233841&doi=10.1155%2f2024%2f4067721&partnerID=40&md5=2e9824574f0ac4cf6bbe6b8a79708204","","","","","","","Cited by: 3","45630.959386574","45631.501597222","Accepted"

The approach leverages the k-means clustering algorithm to group learners with similar leisure interests and incorporates Support Vector Regression to predict student performance, utilizing demographic data and past performance as metrics.

These settings serve as pivotal arenas wherein individuals cultivate their expertise and skills, recognized within organizations as integral components of knowledge management. Similarly, within educational institutions like universities, each educator possesses distinct knowledge assets, refining skills within their specialized domains, often contained as tacit or implicit knowledge awaiting dissemination. Yet, the pursuit of collective knowledge creation faces complexities influenced by the diverse nature of knowledge and the distinct pedagogical landscape. This challenge is particularly pronounced within intelligent learning environments, an emerging educational trend demonstrating its efficacy across diverse sectors. Furthermore, relying solely on academic training proves insufficient in equipping individuals with the technical and technological acumen essential for active engagement within their professional domains. Hence, a fundamental reassessment of the learning continuum becomes imperative, encompassing both course creation and implementation. Educational resources provided to learners require adaptability and reusability, aligning with the demands of smart and adaptive learning systems crucial in the digital era.

ChatTutor is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes: interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. To demonstrate the mechanism of each working module and the benefits of structured memory control and adaptive reflection, we conduct a wide range of analysis based on statistical results and user study. The analysis shows the designed processes boost system consistency and stability under long-term interaction and intentional disruptions, with up to 5% and 20% increase in performance respectively. Meanwhile, we also compare the system with scripts from real-world online learning platform and discuss the potential issues unique to LLM-based systems.  © 2024 Owner/Author.","Conference paper","10.1145/3627673.3679665","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210007673&doi=10.1145%2f3627673.3679665&partnerID=40&md5=e46f2494c0f776f2f1f52aacc8c59596","","","","","","","Cited by: 0; All Open Access, Green Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.491319444","Accepted"
"Gaze-Driven Adaptive Learning System with ChatGPT-Generated Summaries","Santhosh, Jayasankar and Dengel, Andreas and Ishimaru, Shoya","IEEE Access","2024","Scopus","","","Enhancing student engagement and comprehension is crucial for effective learning. However, tracking and improving these dynamic states in real-time remains a significant challenge. This study addresses this gap by integrating real-time engagement prediction from gaze data with an adaptive learning system that utilizes ChatGPT-generated summaries to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Our experiment with twenty two (N=22) university students demonstrates the effectiveness of gaze data in predicting real-time engagement levels and the impact of adaptive interventions on student engagement, objective and subjective comprehension, and cognitive load. To predict the self-reported engagement and comprehension levels, two deep neural network models, InceptionTime and Transformers were employed. The Transformers model achieved better outcomes, with an average accuracy of 68.15% in predicting engagement levels across a 5-fold StratifiedGroupKFold cross-validation. The results revealed that the experimental group, which received the AI-driven interventions, exhibited significantly better learning outcomes, higher engagement, and better objective comprehension results compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed strong correlations between gaze metrics, engagement levels, and learning outcomes, suggesting that real-time adaptive interventions can dynamically enhance the educational experience. This study advances the field of educational technology by demonstrating the benefits of integrating gaze tracking and AI in learning environments, laying the foundation for dynamic learning interfaces that adapt to individual engagement levels, potentially improving both comprehension and involvement.  © 2013 IEEE.","Article","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3503059","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210073250&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2024.3503059&partnerID=40&md5=e93caf71ec0716a0eb422f61b752a93d","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45631.537106481","Accepted"

In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been tried to be introduced into intelligent learning services due to their superior performance in processing graph-structured data. This paper aims to provide researchers and engineers with a general overview of modeling processes and techniques for intelligent learning services based on GNNs. Through a careful review of the advanced models published between 2019 and 2023, existing research primarily focuses on four detailed areas within the smart services scenario. The GNN models involved are systematically classified, and the principles, pioneers and variants of various models are summarized in detail. Simultaneously, this paper analyzes the applications, the specific problems to be solved, and the technologies and innovations of graph-based models in the four key areas.

However, the availability of quantitative models for personalized playback speed control considering the learner's personal traits is still an open question. The work aims to develop a model to control the personalized playback speed of audio information for beginners and experienced learners for intelligent tutoring systems. Analysis of the data from the experimental study using traditional machine learning methods did not allow us to classify the preferred playback rate with accuracy higher than 60%. Therefore, we developed the three-level hierarchical logistic model that predicts the preferred playback speed of audio material on the scale from 'very low speed' to 'high speed' for beginners and experienced learners with 80% accuracy. The model uses a combination of cognitive and psychomotor traits of individual learners and aims to maximize audio listening convenience and satisfaction. We explained the influence of the learners' selected personal traits on the preferred speed of audio playback. We calculated the convenience of listening to the audio materials without and with the model. By using the model, the convenience of listening to audio materials increased by an average of 13% at a low speech speed and 37% at a high speech speed. The model extends the control theory of multimedia information in e-learning systems by describing the influence of selected psychophysiological traits of learners on the preferred playback speed of audio materials.<br/></div> © 2008-2011 IEEE.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2024.3439470","","","Adaptive control systems;Cognitive systems;Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Hierarchical systems;Learning systems;","","19391382","English","Adaptation models;Adaptive learning;Cognitive loads;Electronic learning;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Personalized e-learning;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.61119213","Duplicated"

In the learner model, acknowledging the affective aspects of learning is important for a range of learner outcomes, including motivation, persistence, and engagement. Learners’ affective states can be detected using physical (e.g. cameras) and physiological sensors (e.g., EEG) in online learning. Although these detectors demonstrate high accuracy, they raise privacy concerns for learners and present challenges in deploying them on a large scale to larger groups of students or in classroom settings. Consequently, researchers have designed an alternative method that can recognise students’ affective states at any point during online learning from their interaction with a computer-based learning platform (i.e. intelligent tutoring systems) without using any sensors. Existing sensor-free affect detectors however, are less accurate and not directly generalisable to other domains and systems. This research focuses on developing generalisable sensor-free affect detectors to identify students’ frustration during online learning using machine learning classifiers. The detectors were built by identifying minimal optimal features associated with frustration from the high-dimensional feature space through a series of experiments on a real-world students’ affective dataset, which are generalisable across various learning platforms and domains. To evaluate their accuracy and generalisability, the detectors’ performance was validated on two independent datasets collected from different educational institutions. The experimental results show that cost-sensitive Bayesian classifiers can achieve higher affect detection accuracies with a small number of generalisable features compared to other classifiers. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","10.1007/s11257-024-09402-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196724153&doi=10.1007%2fs11257-024-09402-4&partnerID=40&md5=5154c11a564d04dcc285a6e0614157c2","","","","","","","Cited by: 0; All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access","45630.959386574","45631.611030093","Duplicated"

This advantage enables researchers to assess learners’ mastery through their learning trajectories, thereby facilitating personalized education and support. Knowledge tracing, an effective educational aid, simulates students’ implicit knowledge states and predicts their mastery over knowledge based on their historical answer records. However, for newly developed online learning platforms, the lack of sufficient historical answer data may impede accurate prediction of students’ knowledge states, rendering existing knowledge tracing models less effective. This paper introduces the first pre-trained knowledge tracing model that leverages a substantial amount of existing data for pre-training and a smaller dataset for fine-tuning. Validated across several publicly available knowledge tracing datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvement in tracing performance on small datasets, with a maximum AUC increase of 5.07%. Beyond incorporating small datasets, our approach of pre-training the entire dataset has shown an enhanced AUC compared to the baseline, marking a novel direction in knowledge tracing research.

To explore this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, analyzing recent studies on the use of GenAI chatbots as intelligent tutoring systems within the CoI framework. The findings revealed that GenAI chatbots enhance cognitive presence through personalized learning paths and real-time feedback, improve social presence by fostering community and continuous support, and strengthen teaching presence by automating administrative tasks and dynamic instructional strategies. These enhancements suggest that integrating GenAI chatbots can significantly enrich online learning environments, making education more dynamic, personalized, and effective.

It analyses user behavior and customizes personalized learning strategies for users through artificial intelligence technology. ITS encompasses a variety of entities and multiple relations, making it suitable to be represented as a graph. This perfectly aligns with the utilization of graph embedding (GE) for downstream ITS tasks. Existing GE methods cannot effectively model ITS data because the user evolution in ITS is discrete in time. The patterns of variation in user states are similar to each other but not correlated at the temporal level. Because of the hierarchical structure caused by the discrete evolution, encoding ITS data in a hyperbolic space is more sensible. We define a discrete evolution graph (DEG) to characterize ITS and propose a method called DEGE to embed it. The static nodes in a DEG are projected randomly and then transformed into hyperbolic space. Next, employ hyperbolic evolution networks to generate the embedding of dynamic nodes. The aggregated features of each node are then delivered by hyperbolic aggregation networks and are concatenated to generate the final higher-order features. To validate the superiority, design a multi-objective loss function with preserving pairwise proximity and preserving link types to train the model on several real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on both question annotation and performance prediction in ITS.<br/></div> © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122451","","","Behavioral research;E-learning;Graph embeddings;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Online systems;","","09574174","English","Dynamic graph;Embeddings;Graph embeddings;Hyperbolic embedding;Hyperbolic spaces;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Offline;Online learning;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.629872685","Duplicated"

For instance, many online ITSs are accessible to students 24/7, have multi-modality (desktop, mobile, virtual reality systems), and provide consistent curricula across students, classes, and schools. A growing design consideration of ITSs is the customization of the student experience. Modern systems tailor the curriculum to each student’s performance by providing remediation when students perform poorly or accelerating a student through lessons when strong proficiency is demonstrated. A challenge to these systems is that this customization is traditionally reactionary and only adjusts the student’s learning plan after the student has performed sub-optimally or overachieved. Proactive interventions often rely on a shared and generalized predictive algorithm that is trained on a collection of students’ past performances but applied to individual students. The presented work investigates the inconsistencies of these generalized predictive models to demonstrate that one algorithm does not work best for all students. This work sets the groundwork for the human digital twin, which models the individual student progression through an ITS and customizes the student performance predictive capabilities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Conference paper","10.1007/978-3-031-62277-9_19","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197457878&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-62277-9_19&partnerID=40&md5=167a15843766060085d6b89034fdc080","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.976273148","Duplicated"
"Empowering Private Tutoring by Chaining Large Language Models","Chen, Yulin and Ding, Ning and Zheng, Hai-Tao and Liu, Zhiyuan and Sun, Maosong and Zhou, Bowen","","2024","ACM Digital Library","354–364","","Artificial intelligence has been applied in various aspects of online education to facilitate teaching and learning. However, few approaches have been made towards a complete AI-powered tutoring system. In this work, we explore the development of a full-fledged intelligent tutoring system based on large language models (LLMs). The proposed system ChatTutor, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, is equipped with automatic course planning and adjusting, informative instruction, and adaptive quiz offering and evaluation. ChatTutor is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes: interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. To demonstrate the mechanism of each working module and the benefits of structured memory control and adaptive reflection, we conduct a wide range of analysis based on statistical results and user study. The analysis shows the designed processes boost system consistency and stability under long-term interaction and intentional disruptions, with up to 5\% and 20\% increase in performance respectively. Meanwhile, we also compare the system with scripts from real-world online learning platform and discuss the potential issues unique to LLM-based systems.","","10.1145/3627673.3679665","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3627673.3679665","","","adaptive reflection, intelligent tutoring system, large language models, memory mechanism","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45630.973020833","Duplicated"

However, many existing adaptive learning systems often fail to meet the diverse needs and preferences of learners, typically relying on unique factors such as learning style. To address this, a robust framework is proposed, incorporating an artificial intelligence (AI) driven adaptive learning model capable of considering multiple factors, including past performance, hobbies, and learning style. The approach leverages the k-means clustering algorithm to group learners with similar leisure interests and incorporates Support Vector Regression to predict student performance, utilizing demographic data and past performance as metrics. Furthermore, the implementation of the Personalized Study Guide plugin, based on k-means clustering, enables the system to create personalized learning paths tailored to individual learning styles. By adopting this approach, the objective is to enhance learner engagement and performance through the development of a robust adaptive learning system. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

However, the behaviors that elementary school students frequently exhibit during online learning particularly when they are in a low attention state have rarely been investigated. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to continuously track changes in the learner's attention state during online learning. A new EEG index reflecting elementary students' attention level was developed using an EEG dataset acquired from 34th graders during a computerized d2 test of attention. Characteristic behaviors of 24 elementary students in a low attention state were then identified from the webcam videos showing their upper bodies captured during 40-min online lectures, with the proposed EEG index being used as a reference to determine their attention level at the time. Various characteristic behaviors were identified regarding the participant's mouth, head, arms, and torso. For example, opening the mouth or leaning back was observed more frequently in a low-attention state than in a high-attention state. It is expected that the characteristic behaviors reflecting a learner's low attention state would be utilized as a useful reference in developing more interactive and effective online education systems. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Article","10.1109/TLT.2023.3289498","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163552081&doi=10.1109%2fTLT.2023.3289498&partnerID=40&md5=eacf59bb70f76a754d78d8d1fb4006fe","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.972407407","Duplicated"

This research conducted two experimental studies to investigate what and how multimodal data can be used to measure and classify learners' real-time cognitive load. The results found that it was a promising method to predict learners' cognitive load by analysing their handwriting, touch gestural and eye-tracking data individually and conjunctively. The machine learning approach used in this research achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.86 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 0.85/0.86 sensitivity/specificity by only using handwriting data, 0.93 AUC and 0.93/0.94 sensitivity/specificity by only using touch gestural data, and 0.94 AUC and 0.94/0.95 sensitivity/specificity by using both the touch gestural and eye-tracking data. The results can contribute to the optimization of cognitive load and the development of adaptive learning systems for pen-based mobile learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Pen-based mobile learning systems allow natural ways of handwriting and gestural touching, which can facilitate learners' cognitive processes in mobile learning. Behavioural and physiological multimodal data are helpful in detecting learners' real-time cognitive load in mobile learning. The effectiveness of behavioural and physiological multimodal data for measuring cognitive load in pen-based mobile learning is limited investigated.

It analyses user behavior and customizes personalized learning strategies for users through artificial intelligence technology. ITS encompasses a variety of entities and multiple relations, making it suitable to be represented as a graph. This perfectly aligns with the utilization of graph embedding (GE) for downstream ITS tasks. Existing GE methods cannot effectively model ITS data because the user evolution in ITS is discrete in time. The patterns of variation in user states are similar to each other but not correlated at the temporal level. Because of the hierarchical structure caused by the discrete evolution, encoding ITS data in a hyperbolic space is more sensible. We define a discrete evolution graph (DEG) to characterize ITS and propose a method called DEGE to embed it. The static nodes in a DEG are projected randomly and then transformed into hyperbolic space. Next, employ hyperbolic evolution networks to generate the embedding of dynamic nodes. The aggregated features of each node are then delivered by hyperbolic aggregation networks and are concatenated to generate the final higher-order features. To validate the superiority, design a multi-objective loss function with preserving pairwise proximity and preserving link types to train the model on several real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on both question annotation and performance prediction in ITS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122451","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177810545&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.122451&partnerID=40&md5=333e623ba0b59cc64b4bd74a8c30a114","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45631.611041667","Duplicated"

E-learning systems provide opportunity for systematic data collection about learning activities offering valuable insights into the students’ knowledge. In order to achieve the personalised learning, this study introduces a Knowledge Design and Delivery Model (KDDM) for intelligent tutoring systems. This model uses a hybrid approach that combines traditional overlay student models with fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision-making methods. Unlike popular machine learning approaches, these methods do not require existing datasets and they allow direct teacher involvement in knowledge delivery. The KDDM associates student stereotypes with Bloom’s revised taxonomy levels, providing a reference point for the cybernetic model.

"Empowering Personalized Learning through a Conversation-based Tutoring System with Student Modeling","Park, Minju and Kim, Sojung and Lee, Seunghyun and Kwon, Soonwoo and Kim, Kyuseok","","2024","ACM Digital Library","","","As the recent Large Language Models(LLM’s) become increasingly competent in zero-shot and few-shot reasoning across various domains, educators are showing a growing interest in leveraging these LLM’s in conversation-based tutoring systems. However, building a conversation-based personalized tutoring system poses considerable challenges in accurately assessing the student and strategically incorporating the assessment into teaching within the conversation. In this paper, we discuss design considerations for a personalized tutoring system that involves the following two key components: (1) a student modeling with diagnostic components, and (2) a conversation-based tutor utilizing LLM with prompt engineering that incorporates student assessment outcomes and various instructional strategies. Based on these design considerations, we created a proof-of-concept tutoring system focused on personalization and tested it with 20 participants. The results substantiate that our system’s framework facilitates personalization, with particular emphasis on the elements constituting student modeling.

The massive learning resources lead to information overload and low resource utilization. Intelligent tutoring system (ITS) plays a vital role in the education platform, providing personalized learning services for students. The data obtained from the online education platform has complex correlations, which can be potentially transformed into multi-level graph structures. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been tried to be introduced into intelligent learning services due to their superior performance in processing graph-structured data. This paper aims to provide researchers and engineers with a general overview of modeling processes and techniques for intelligent learning services based on GNNs. Through a careful review of the advanced models published between 2019 and 2023, existing research primarily focuses on four detailed areas within the smart services scenario. The GNN models involved are systematically classified, and the principles, pioneers and variants of various models are summarized in detail. Simultaneously, this paper analyzes the applications, the specific problems to be solved, and the technologies and innovations of graph-based models in the four key areas.

"What makes tablet-based learning effective? A study of the role of real-time adaptive feedback","Colliot, Tiphaine and Krichen, Omar and Girard, Nathalie and Anquetil, Éric and Jamet, Éric","British Journal of Educational Technology","2024","Scopus","2278 – 2295","55","This study investigated the added value of real-time adaptive feedback on seventh graders' performances in tablet-based geometry learning. To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance. Our data therefore indicate that artificial intelligence is a promising way of providing learners with real-time adaptive feedback in order to improve their performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Previous meta-analyses have investigated the effects of tablet-based learning. Tablet computers have been proven to increase students' motivation. Yet, the influence of tablet computers on learning outcomes remains inconclusive. Other studies show that certain features of environments, such as feedback, have positive effects on learning. What this paper adds Most of the previous studies adopted a media comparison approach (paper- vs. tablet-based instruction). We combine this approach with an added-value approach by adding or not real-time AI-based feedback. Results showed that tablet use increased children's interest but not their learning outcomes. Feedback improved children's performance in a training task and a later transfer paper task. Implications for practice and/or policy Tablet computers can promote students' interest in the task during geometry instruction. App features play a critical role in improving students' learning. Specifically, IA-based adaptive feedback helps children to perform better on a geometry task. © 2024 The Authors.

"Mobile-Optimized AI-Driven Personalized Learning: A Case Study at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University","Baba, Khalid and El Faddouli, Nour-Eddine and Cheimanoff, Nicolas","International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies","2024","Scopus","81 – 96","18","With the rise of mobile learning platforms, it has become increasingly evident that individuals require personalized experiences that are tailored to the strengths and limitations of mobile devices. The present study explores the significant impact that personalized mobile learning environments, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), could have. This study specifically evaluates the impact of an AI-driven personalized educational platform, designed for mobile devices, on the academic achievement and educational progress of students at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The platform, designed for mobile devices, allows instructors to easily upload information. Learners can interact with an AI mentor through a chat interface that is seamlessly integrated into their mobile course materials. The system, constructed using cutting-edge technologies such as Langchain, Pinecone, and the LLM Model, excels at providing personalized, real-time feedback and support for learners who are frequently mobile. This study compared two groups of students. One group had access to a mobile personalized learning platform powered by AI, whereas the control group did not have access to it. We conducted a comparative analysis of mobile educational experiences, levels of engagement, and academic outcomes across these groups. In addition, qualitative feedback was gathered from educators and students to evaluate the mobile usability and effectiveness of the system. The results of our study demonstrate that the AI-driven mobile-tailored learning system significantly improves the experience of mobile learners. The increased levels of engagement, improved understanding, and superior academic achievements support our claim. This study not only supports the potential of AI-driven personalized mobile learning in higher education but also emphasizes the importance of continuous innovation to improve its usefulness and effectiveness. © 2024 by the authors of this article.

"L@S '24: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale","","","2024","ACM Digital Library","","","It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956261574","45630.982326389","Rejected"

"Interplay of academic emotion regulation, academic mindfulness, L2 learning experience, academic motivation, and learner autonomy in intelligent computer-assisted language learning: A study of EFL learners","Ehsan Namaziandost and Afsheen Rezai","System","2024","ScienceDirect","103419","125","In the evolving landscape of second language (L2) education, Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) stands out as a transformative force with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite its growing prominence, integrating cognitive and affective constructs such as academic emotion regulation and mindfulness remains underexplored in ICALL environments. This study addresses this gap by examining their interplay with L2 learning experience, academic motivation, and learner autonomy among Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Drawing on data from 398 intermediate EFL learners, this research utilized a comprehensive array of validated instruments, including the Academic Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, the Langer Mindfulness Scale, the L2 Learning Experience Scale, the Academic Motivation Scale, and the Learner Autonomy Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed significant correlations, indicating that academic emotion regulation positively influences L2 learning experience, academic motivation, and learner autonomy within ICALL settings. Furthermore, academic mindfulness emerged as a robust predictor of these educational outcomes in ICALL environments. These findings underscore the pivotal role of ICALL in L2 education and offer practical insights for teachers, curriculum developers, and policymakers to enhance teaching and learning practices.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2024.103419","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X2400201X","","","Academic emotion regulation, Academic mindfulness, Academic motivation, Learner autonomy, Intelligent computer-assisted language learning, L2 learning experience, EFL learners","","0346-251X","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

However, data sparsity remains a significant challenge in the KT domain. To address this challenge, this paper applies quantum computing (QC) technology to KT for the first time. It proposes two personalized KT models incorporating quantum mechanics (QM): quantum convolutional enhanced knowledge tracing (QCE-KT) and quantum variational enhanced knowledge tracing (QVE-KT). Through quantum superposition and entanglement properties, QCE-KT and QVE-KT effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem in the KT domain through quantum convolutional layers and variational quantum circuits, respectively, and significantly improve the quality of the representation and prediction accuracy of students’ knowledge states. Experiments on three datasets show that our models outperform ten benchmark models. On the most sparse dataset, QCE-KT and QVE-KT improve their performance by 16.44% and 14.78%, respectively, compared to DKT. Although QC is still in the developmental stage, this study reveals the great potential of QM in personalized KT, which provides new perspectives for solving personalized instruction problems and opens up new directions for applying QC in education.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2024.102224","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157824003136","","","Personalized instruction, Knowledge tracing, Quantum computing, Data sparsity, Neural network","","1319-1578","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"An evolving learning style detection approach for online education using bipartite graph embedding","Bello Ahmad Muhammad and Chao Qi and Zhenqiang Wu and Hafsa Kabir Ahmad","Applied Soft Computing","2024","ScienceDirect","111230","152","The increasingly widespread online education recently enabled a new form of teaching, learning, and overall educational outcome. However, the need of personalization is required as learners learn differently and learning follows a one-size-fits-all approach. Learning style is the most used personalization that plays an important role in learning. This learning style is a changeable trait that is influenced by the learner's behavior based on past experiences. As a result, knowing it over time helps to point learners in the right direction, motivate them, and enhance their learning outcomes. Research done so far does not take into account the changes in the behavior of learners, and the behavioral data is at large volume, making the existing approaches fail to capture and extract the behavior of learners efficiently. Inspired by these constraints, we propose an incremental learning style detection approach for online education with a bipartite graph embedding technique. We first construct a dynamic bipartite graph to represent the incremental interaction between learners and learning resources while learning. Then, introduce a dynamic bipartite graph embedding to learn the low dimensional representation of the constructed graph from the current and previous time. Finally, the low dimensional features are mapped to the selected Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) dimension each time to identify and group similar learners using the k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed approach can be integrated into different educational systems. Extensive experiments conducted using three datasets from 2015 KDD Cup courses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Average of 93.19%, 95.76%, and 98.48% are achieved across the three datasets in accuracy compared to the existing approaches.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2024.111230","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624000048","","","Learning style, Bipartite graph embedding, Felder-Silverman learning style model, Learner modeling, Human-computer interactions","","1568-4946","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"Progressive knowledge tracing: Modeling learning process from abstract to concrete","Jianwen Sun and Mengqi Wei and Jintian Feng and Fenghua Yu and Qing Li and Rui Zou","Expert Systems with Applications","2024","ScienceDirect","122280","238","Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences that support the dream of “teaching students according to their aptitude”. Knowledge tracing (KT) is a critical research topic in intelligent education and is a powerful tool for achieving AI-assisted education. Both the learning process and the response result are important for KT. However, existing KT methods rarely employ a stage-based modeling approach to dissect the learning process. We propose Progressive Knowledge Tracing (PKT), which models the learning process in stages. PKT decomposes the learning process into three relatively independent but progressively related stages: concept mastery, question solving, and answering behavior. Inspired by constructivist learning theory and item response theory, PKT incorporates interpretable parameters with educational significance. Compared with existing KT methods, this staged modeling method that integrates educational theory has more reasonable interpretability. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that PKT outperforms baseline methods. Several experiments show that PKT reasonably models the learning process. For example, it more reasonably estimates the trend of concept mastery over time, analyzes the reasons why learners make mistakes on specific questions, and provides estimates of question difficulty that are closer to reality. We also find the intuitive phenomenon that the difficulty of a question is positively correlated with the number of associated concepts.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122280","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423027823","","","Knowledge tracing, Learning process, Artificial intelligence in education, Learner modeling","","0957-4174","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

Through an examination of the Web of Science or WoS, a total of 29 studies were selected for review. We extracted information on the XReality with AI trends in the studies and further classified the pedagogical impact of the studies using the E3XReality framework suggesting that XReality technology may fall into three levels (three Es for XR hence E3XR): 1) Ethics (making sure we do and receive no harm in learning), 2) Educational effectiveness (making sure learning is effective to our goals and outcomes), and 3) Eudaimonia (making sure learning is both effective and ethical). Using open and axial coding, we find that a survey of perceptions or review of the literature was most often made, followed by the study of technical and pedagogical interventions. VR followed by MR was noted the most in the reviewed studies and surprisingly no mention of AR in the silo was made. The use of AI with XReality was mostly done to provide actionable insight, followed by insight and control. The analysis of studies against the conceptual framework E3XReality suggested that current work is largely at the education state and more work is needed to transition to a more sophisticated state of Eudaimonia. Further, several challenges were obtained from the 29 reviewed studies. The contribution of this paper is to offer an extensive synthesis of challenges as well as future recommendations for using XReality with AI in education.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cexr.2024.100052","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949678024000023","","","Extended reality, XR, Artificial intelligence, AI, Education","","2949-6780","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"The effectiveness of empathic chatbot feedback for developing computer competencies, motivation, self-regulation, and metacognitive reasoning in online higher education","Elvis Ortega-Ochoa and José {Quiroga Pérez} and Marta Arguedas and Thanasis Daradoumis and Joan Manuel {Marquès Puig}","Internet of Things","2024","ScienceDirect","101101","25","At the forefront of Artificial Intelligence of Things, this paper delves into empathic agents to revolutionize computer competencies acquisition and catalyze motivational, regulatory, and metacognitive dynamics in online higher education. Previous research on student processing of empathic feedback has been limited, often neglecting learning performance and its impact on students’ motivation, self-regulation, and metacognitive reasoning. The objective was to analyze the effectiveness of empathic feedback, cognitive and affective, on these four issues in online learning. A quasi-experimental design was used, in which a conversational agent, DSLab-Bot, was integrated into the syllabus and Information Technology infrastructure. Students from an online university's Distributed Systems course participated (N= 196), selected through one-stage cluster probability sampling. They were divided into experimental and control groups receiving feedback from DSLab-Bot and the teacher, respectively. Results showed no significant differences between the groups in learning performance, motivation, or self-regulation, except in one item of motivation (self-efficacy) and self-regulation. There were strong correlations between thirteen cognitive (1–4, 6, 7, 9–15) and seven affective (1, 4–9) chatbot feedback types with conceptual change (MRCC) and personal growth and understanding (MRPGU). There were high weights of similar chatbot feedback types indicating a pronounced influence of these on metacognitive reasoning components, even self-reflection (MRSR). In conclusion, empathic chatbot feedback is as effective as human teacher feedback in facilitating learning, motivation, and self-regulation. Moreover, specific empathic feedback types are crucial in fostering MRCC, MRPGU, and MRSR strongly. Practitioners should consider these specific types of empathic feedback for future empathic agent configurations.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iot.2024.101101","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254266052400043X","","","Artificial Intelligence of Things, Cognitive feedback, Affective feedback, Competency based teaching, Motivation, Self-regulation, Metacognitive reasoning","","2542-6605","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

Without transforming technology-enhanced learning environments into SLE, they are restricted to adding sophistication and lack pedagogical benefits, leading to wasteful educational investments. SLE research has grown over time, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021, which fundamentally altered the “landscape” of technology use in education. This study aims to discover how the stages of SLE transform from time to time by applying two bibliometric analysis approaches: publication performance analysis and science mapping. The dataset was created by extracting bibliometric data from Scopus, including 427 articles, 162 publication sources (journals and proceeding), and 1080 authors from 2002 to 2022. Three kinds of SLE research subjects were identified by keyword synthesis: SLE features, technological innovation, and adaptive learning systems. Adaptive learning and personalized learning are consistently used interchangeably to demonstrate the significance of supporting the diversity of student and teacher conditions. Learning analytics, essential to employing big data technology for educational data mining, is a new theme being considered increasingly in the future to achieve adaptive and personalized learning.

We wanted to find out the emerging technologies used in computing education, its evaluation and effectiveness, and limitations and gaps for future research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education.

"A holistic framework to model student's cognitive process in mathematics education through fuzzy cognitive maps","Mario Lepore","Heliyon","2024","ScienceDirect","e35863","10","This study introduces a pioneering framework for modeling students' cognitive processes in mathematics education through Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). By integrating key educational theories—Duval's Semiotic Representation Theory, Niss's Mathematical Competencies, Marton's Variation Theory, and the broad Engagement, Motivation, and Participation framework— the model offers a comprehensive and holistic understanding of students' cognitive landscapes. This research underscores the necessity of a multidimensional approach to capturing the intricate interplay of cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors in students' mathematical learning experiences. The novelty lies in its methodological innovation, employing FCMs to transcend traditional qualitative analyzes and facilitate quantitative insights into students' cognitive processes. This approach is particularly relevant in the current era dominated by digital learning environments and artificial intelligence, where real-time, automated analysis of student interactions is increasingly vital. The proposed FCM has been developed over the years with a data-driven approach; the concepts and relationships in it have been derived from the literature and refined by the author's experience in the field. Illustrated through case studies, the framework's utility is demonstrated in diverse contexts, highlighting how the quantitative data obtained are confirmed by qualitative approach: analyzing the impact of remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic on student engagement and exploring Augmented Reality's role in enhancing mathematical conceptualization. These applications show the framework's adaptability and its potential to integrate new technologies in educational practices. However, the transition from qualitative to quantitative methodologies poses a challenge, given the prevalent use of qualitative approaches in mathematics education research. Additionally, the technological implementation of the FCM model in educational software presents practical hurdles, necessitating further development to ensure ease of integration and use in real-time educational settings. Future work will focus on bridging these methodological gaps and overcoming technological challenges to broaden the FCM model's applicability and enhance its contribution to advancing mathematics education.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35863","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024118944","","","Student's cognitive model, Fuzzy cognitive map, Mathematics education, Quantitative research, Qualitative research","","2405-8440","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

It analyses user behavior and customizes personalized learning strategies for users through artificial intelligence technology. ITS encompasses a variety of entities and multiple relations, making it suitable to be represented as a graph. This perfectly aligns with the utilization of graph embedding (GE) for downstream ITS tasks. Existing GE methods cannot effectively model ITS data because the user evolution in ITS is discrete in time. The patterns of variation in user states are similar to each other but not correlated at the temporal level. Because of the hierarchical structure caused by the discrete evolution, encoding ITS data in a hyperbolic space is more sensible. We define a discrete evolution graph (DEG) to characterize ITS and propose a method called DEGE to embed it. The static nodes in a DEG are projected randomly and then transformed into hyperbolic space. Next, employ hyperbolic evolution networks to generate the embedding of dynamic nodes. The aggregated features of each node are then delivered by hyperbolic aggregation networks and are concatenated to generate the final higher-order features. To validate the superiority, design a multi-objective loss function with preserving pairwise proximity and preserving link types to train the model on several real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on both question annotation and performance prediction in ITS.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122451","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423029536","","","Intelligent tutoring systems, Graph embedding, Dynamic graph, Hyperbolic embedding","","0957-4174","","","45805.948819444","45805.948819444","Rejected"

"A knowledge graph and BiLSTM-CRF-enabled intelligent adaptive learning model and its potential application","Yiting Zhu","Alexandria Engineering Journal","2024","ScienceDirect","305-320","91","The significant advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has led to the gradual emergence of intelligent adaptive learning as a pivotal modality for acquiring knowledge. The knowledge graph, as a crucial component of the intelligent adaptive learning model, assumes the vital responsibility of guiding and facilitating the learning process while evaluating its outcomes. The current knowledge graph, however, presents several challenges including fragmented knowledge content, inadequate ability characterization, and limited automatic construction capabilities, which hinder its effectiveness in assisting learners to achieve their learning objectives. The paper proposes the knowledge-resource-objective (KRO) model of knowledge graph, based on a robust correlation between knowledge, learning resources, and learning objectives. In the KRO model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is utilized for data pre-processing. Protége is employed for ontology construction. Entities and relations are synchronously annotated using the Main-Entity+ Relation +Begin-Inside-End-Single-Other (ME+R+BIESO) corpus labeling model to complete the triplet construction. Additionally, entities and relations are extracted synchronously utilizing a Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) model. Knowledge visualization and reasoning are achieved through Neo4j graph database. The study employs the Letter of Credit as a case study to examine the application of the KRO model, and assesses its efficacy through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

"Global and local neural cognitive modeling for student performance prediction","Yu Su and Shuanghong Shen and Linbo Zhu and Le Wu and Zhenya Huang and Zeyu Cheng and Qi Liu and Shijin Wang","Expert Systems with Applications","2024","ScienceDirect","121637","237","Student performance prediction is a critical task in supporting decision-making for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Correct predictions of student performance are prerequisites for ITS to supply intelligent services and optimize learning efficiency, e.g., recommending the most appropriate learning resources for each student. Existing methods mainly include cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing, both of which focus on students’ cognitive modeling based on their interactions on a sequence of items and give predictions by assessing if their cognitive states can meet the item requirements. Specifically, cognitive diagnosis only considers students’ global static cognitive states, while knowledge tracing focuses on students’ local dynamics. However, both global and local features are critical for predicting student performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Global and Local Neural Cognitive (GLNC) model to capture both global and local features in student-item interactions for more accurate predictions. Specifically, we first learn students’ global cognitive level according to all student-item interactions. Then, we propose a self-attentive encoder based on the scaled dot-product attention mechanism to extract the local cognitive dynamics and the dependencies between students’ recent interactions. Finally, to obtain better predictions, we design a fused gate based on the similarity between students’ recently responded items and the item to be predicted to adaptively combine the global and local features. To evaluate the effectiveness of GLNC, we compare it with both cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing methods. All experiments are conducted on three public datasets that contain real student-item interactions on mathematics or language courses from various ITS. The experimental results demonstrate that GLNC achieves an average score of 0.7810 on the AUC metric, 0.7627 on the ACC metric, 0.3987 on the RMSE metric, 0.2023 on the r2 metric, respectively achieving an average improvement of 1.84%, 1.07%, 1.87%, and 11.38% in contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods (i.e., NCD and LPKT). Moreover, we further analyze the performance of GLNC under different probabilities of guessing and slipping, the results indicate that GLNC is more robust against the influence of noisy data while considering both global and local features. Benefiting from the superior accuracy and stability, our proposed GLNC has a wide range of potential implications for ITS, which can be easily applied to improve students’ learning efficiency and experience.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121637","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423021395","","","Knowledge tracing, Cognitive diagnosis, Student performance prediction, Student modeling","","0957-4174","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Why traditional firms from the same industry reject digital transformation: Structural constraints of perception and attention","Erik Fernandes and Ana Burcharth","Long Range Planning","2024","ScienceDirect","102426","57","We explain why some traditional companies fail to sense new digital technologies when facing an identical scenario of digital transformation. Our objective is to investigate situations where discontinuous changes steaming from digital transformation are actively rejected, in the sense that they are not perceived as a strategic issue, i.e., a threat or opportunity. We draw on a mixed-method research design comprising two sequential studies. The first study is based on Delphi's Technique, which uses a panel of specialists to build the most likely future scenarios in the medium term for the language education industry. The second one is a qualitative comparative study with eleven traditional firms. Their senior executives were first asked for their spontaneous sensing of emerging technologies and later asked to provide their assessment of the most likely future scenarios. Our contribution lies in developing a conceptual model that proposes a structural “schema-driven” explanation of why firm-level structures – concrete, contextual and knowledge – can hinder perception and attention. Active rejection is prompted not by the absence of attentional structures, but by their specific attributes. This expands the dominant ontology of issues, asserting their existence independently of an organization's epistemological experience, and adds to the theoretical understanding regarding the constraints of the sensing dynamic capability in digital transformation.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2024.102426","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002463012400013X","","","Digital transformation, Attention-based view, Dynamic capabilities, Sensing capability, Cognition","","0024-6301","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Improving the performance and explainability of knowledge tracing via Markov blanket","Bo Jiang and Yuang Wei and Ting Zhang and Wei Zhang","Information Processing & Management","2024","ScienceDirect","103620","61","Knowledge tracing predicts student knowledge acquisition states during learning. Traditional knowledge tracing methods suffer from poor prediction performance; however, recent studies have significantly improved prediction performance through the incorporation of deep neural networks. However, prediction results generated from deep knowledge tracing methods are typically difficult to explain. To solve this issue, a knowledge tracing model using Markov blankets was proposed to improve the interpretability of knowledge tracing. The proposed method uses the Markov blanket of the target variable as a subset of features and applies interpretable machine learning techniques to knowledge tracing. The results from the ablation experiments demonstrate that the feature subspace created by the Markov blanket is substantially effective for prediction. The proposed model also performs better than several other knowledge tracing models on two widely used datasets, i.e., Junyi and ASSISTments. Furthermore, the use of Markov blanket-based features provides high interpretability for predicting knowledge mastery states, elucidating the impact of these features on student knowledge acquisition. Moreover, this enables the use of previously considered low-correlation features, which may possess important latent causal relationships.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103620","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457323003576","","","Knowledge tracing, Markov blanket, Interpretable models, Educational AI, Causal discovery","","0306-4573","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

In this sense, a series of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) proposed models were trained using these methods. The selection of the best-fit model depends on finding an excellent connection between inputs and output(s) layers in training and testing datasets (e.g., a combination of expert knowledge, experimentation, and validation techniques). The study's primary result is a division of the participants into two performance-based groups (failed and non-failed). The experimental data used to build the models measured fourteen process variables: relocation, gender, age at enrollment, debtor, nationality, educational special needs, current tuition fees, scholarship holder, unemployment, inflation, GDP, application order, day/evening attendance, and admission grade. During the model evaluation, a scoring system was created in addition to using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the efficacy of the utilized approaches. Further research revealed that the HHO-ANFIS is superior to the EWA-ANFIS. With AUC = 0.8004 and 0.7886, MSE of 0.62689 and 0.65598, and MAE of 0.64105 and 0.65746, the failure of the pupils was assessed with the most significant degree of accuracy. The MSE, MAE, and AUC precision indicators showed that the EWA-ANFIS is less accurate, having MSE amounts of 0.71543 and 0.71776, MAE amounts of 0.70819 and 0.71518, and AUC amounts of 0.7565 and 0.758.

"Self-paced contrastive learning for knowledge tracing","Huan Dai and Yue Yun and Yupei Zhang and Rui An and Wenxin Zhang and Xuequn Shang","Neurocomputing","2024","ScienceDirect","128366","609","Knowledge tracing presents a fundamental research challenge within personalized education, aiming to dynamically monitor students’ evolving mastery of individual skills through analysis of their online answer data. Noteworthy advancements have been achieved in knowledge tracing models, particularly with the integration of deep learning techniques. These models leverage long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks to process students’ answer sequences, discern latent skill states, and predict subsequent responses. Nevertheless, real-world scenarios introduce a substantial challenge, given the inherent sparsity of student interaction data, implying that each student interacts with only a limited number of skills. Deep knowledge tracing models, when confronted with sparse data, tend to exhibit a bias towards learning from students with large sample sizes, consequently resulting in compromised learning outcomes due to insufficient interaction data. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative self-paced learning data augmentation approach designed to augment the number of student answer sequence samples. Additionally, the paper employs self-supervised contrastive learning to strike a balance between local and global information, thereby mitigating the model’s inclination to overly focus on local samples. To effectively address the aforementioned challenges, the paper proposes a deep knowledge tracing framework grounded in self-paced contrastive learning. The efficacy of the self-paced contrastive learning strategy is validated using real datasets, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy compared to alternative algorithms.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2024.128366","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231224011378","","","Knowledge tracing, Self-paced learning, Contrastive learning, Question difficulty ranking","","0925-2312","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) is a technology developed in recent years that employs deep learning techniques to dynamically track students’ learning progress and offer personalized learning support. Yet, existing research often miss the complex interplay between student characteristics and knowledge components, limiting interpretability and adaptability in assessments. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Ontology Perceptible Knowledge Tracing (OPKT) model, a novel approach that reconceptualizes student-knowledge interaction by integrating both student and knowledge ontologies directly into the tracing process. This integration allows for a more nuanced representation of learning interactions, significantly enhancing the predictive precision and interpretability of the model. The OPKT model extracts and utilizes ontology features—deriving student attributes from behavioral data and aligning them with knowledge aspects through sophisticated relationship mapping. This dual-layer integration captures the evolution of knowledge states more accurately, facilitating targeted educational interventions. The results of prediction on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed OPKT model achieves at least a 2% improvement in AUC, accurately assessing students’ learning outcomes and knowledge proficiency.

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This study has both practical and academic implications by providing recommendations for education policy makers, practitioners and researchers on post-Covid education systems and how to deal with future crises.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100905","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147281172300143X","","","Digital transformation, Educational institution, Education practices, Learning process, Online learning","","1472-8117","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

In recent years, the use of affective computing technology to solve affective loss in online education has become a key research topic. To date, a growing number of studies have investigated automated emotion recognition (AER) in online environments. However, AER has been mainly studied from the perspective of computer science focusing on technical characteristics of developing AI technology while its pedagogical value and educational application has been overlooked. Therefore, this systematic literature review aimed to bring together educational and technical aspects of AER. Following PRISMA methodology, a comprehensive search of AER research from 2010 to 2024 in three databases (Web of Science, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore) identified 117 studies that met inclusion criteria. The articles were coded for report characteristics, educational characteristics (tech platform, pedagogy, assessment, content), technical characteristics (emotion model, emotion category, emotion measurement channel, database, algorithm model) and outcome characteristics (technical result, educational application). We found that the primary purpose of these studies was to develop and evaluate systems for AER, rather than implementing these systems in real online learning environments. Furthermore, our findings indicated a lack of integration between computer science and educational science in the realm of AER. Despite the fact that most algorithm models demonstrated high accuracy in AER, the interpretability of the results was significantly constrained by the quality of the databases used, along with the scarcity of studies focusing on the effective and real-time application of AER results. These findings provide essential guidance for shaping future research and development pathways in this field.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105111","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131524001258","","","Distance education and online learning, Teaching/learning strategies, Affective computing, Emotion recognition, Systematic review","","0360-1315","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Virtual human on social media: Text mining and sentiment analysis","Sihong Li and Jinglong Chen","Technology in Society","2024","ScienceDirect","102666","78","Virtual humans are embodied agents with a human-like appearance. Despite the recent booming development that has sparked widespread academic interest, how people perceive these seemingly human but entirely fictional creations remains unclear. To explore the status, trends, emotional tendencies, and focus of attention of the Chinese public towards virtual humans, this paper utilizes text mining techniques to collect and analyze popular posts related to virtual humans on Chinese social media. The results indicate that public discussions primarily focus on the technological and industrial development of virtual humans, applications in the fields of virtual idols and virtual streamers, and the corporate investment and policy development of virtual humans. Despite positive emotions dominating, there is an increasing trend in negative emotions. Concerns are related to service failures, the uncanny valley effect, ethical crises, and technological unemployment. The research findings contribute to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the public in understanding the general attitudes toward virtual human technology, enabling informed decision-making.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102666","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X24002148","","","Virtual human, Social media, Text mining, Public opinion, Sentiment analysis","","0160-791X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"
"Self-regulated learning strategies, self-efficacy, and learning engagement of EFL students in smart classrooms: A structural equation modeling analysis","Jinfen Xu and Juan Li and Jiaqi Yang","System","2024","ScienceDirect","103451","125","Smart classrooms have become increasingly prevalent in the domain of foreign language education. However, students' EFL learning in smart classrooms, especially their self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, self-efficacy, and learning engagement during the process, remains understudied. Given the significant impact of these factors on students' academic achievement, this study applied a quantitative method to first clarify their respective factor structures, on the basis of which the links between the three were examined via structural equation modeling (SEM). Participants were 1107 undergraduates from different universities in China who had engaged in EFL learning in smart classrooms. The factor analysis revealed a two-facet structure of students’ SRL strategies (goal-planning strategies and help-seeking and self-evaluation strategies), a similar dual-component structure of their self-efficacy (self-efficacy of communicating with instructors and self-efficacy of task completion), and a four-dimensional structure of their engagement (cognitive engagement, behavioral engagement, social engagement, and emotional engagement) during EFL learning in smart classrooms. Moreover, the SEM results showed that SRL strategies did not directly predict learning engagement, while self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship between SRL strategies and learning engagement. The implications and limitations of these findings were also discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2024.103451","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X24002331","","","EFL learning, Smart classrooms, SRL strategies, Self-efficacy, Learning engagement","","0346-251X","","","45805.948726852","45805.948726852","Rejected"

To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%.

Eye-movement data from 43 students while completing online English reading tasks were recorded and 31 eye-movement features were extracted from the taxonomy of fixation, saccade, movement direction and gaze velocity. During the model training phase, LightGBM achieved an accuracy of 96.51 % in detection. An interpretable model, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation), was used to explain the main effects of eye-movement features in detection, where high gaze velocity, absolute saccade direction, and average saccade duration were found to be strong indicators of English reading proficiency. Furthermore, SHAP analysis allows the identification of individual factors contributing to differences in English reading proficiency.

However, the existing methods to safeguard email communication, including spam, phishing, and ham emails, have exhibited suboptimal classification performance and inadequate security. So, this work introduces the Optimized Email Classification Network (OECNet) to categorize emails and mitigate security risks effectively. Leveraging a hybrid dataset comprising spam, phishing, and ham email information, we perform meticulous preprocessing to ensure data uniformity. Our approach incorporates principal component analysis (PCA) to extract email-specific pattern properties, enhancing feature discernment through eigenvalue analysis. Inspired by natural swarm behaviours, we employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select highly correlated features from PCA outcomes, optimizing the model's efficacy. The OECNet uses PSO-optimised features to integrate a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (DLCNN) model for classification. This novel methodology surpasses traditional methods, yielding an accuracy of 98.43 %, precision of 97.78 %, recall of 96.41 %, and an impressive F1-score of 97.07 %. The proposed OECNet advances email classification technology and establishes a robust security framework against malicious intrusions in global communication.

Despite the wealth of video resources, evaluating their effectiveness remains challenging. This study employs a comprehensive approach, analyzing student behavior and video metadata to assess educational videos’ efficacy. Metrics such as average playback speed, video and course completion rates, and video metadata were examined using the XuetangX dataset, MOOC- CubeX. Results indicate that viewing patterns are more influenced by students’ choices than by video content. Well-conceptualized videos increase viewing time, with 17 % of students engaging with videos over 30 min if they cover focused topics. While shorter videos generally have higher completion rates, many remain untouched. Playback speed analysis shows a preference for standard speed, with positive correlations between speed and both completion percentage and viewing time. Courses under 5 h are likely to be watched for less than an hour, reflecting brief viewing durations. Metadata analysis reveals that generic titles may deter engagement, underscoring the importance of precise tagging and content relevance for enhancing student interaction.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39682","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024157131","","","Video-based learning, Online learning, Learning analytics, Student behavior, Video concepts","","2405-8440","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Existing solutions generally follow a collaborative filtering paradigm, while the implicit connections between students (exercises) have been largely ignored. In this study, we aim to propose an exercise recommendation paradigm that can reveal the latent connections between student-student (exercise-exercise). Specifically, a new framework was proposed, namely personalized exercise recommendation with student and exercise portraits (PERP). It consists of three sequential and interdependent modules: Collaborative student exercise graph (CSEG) construction, joint random walk, and recommendation list optimization. Technically, CSEG is created as a unified heterogeneous graph with students’ response behaviors and student (exercise) relationships. Then, a joint random walk to take full advantage of the spectral properties of nearly uncoupled Markov chains is performed on CSEG, which allows for full exploration of both similar exercises that students have finished and connections between students (exercises) with similar portraits. Finally, we propose to optimize the recommendation list to obtain different exercise suggestions. After analyses of two public datasets, the results demonstrated that PERP can satisfy novelty, accuracy, and diversity.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnlest.2024.100262","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674862X24000302","","","Educational data mining, Exercise recommend, Joint random walk, Nearly uncoupled Markov chains, Optimization, Personalized learning","","1674-862X","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

"Explore Bayesian analysis in Cognitive-aware Key–Value Memory Networks for knowledge tracing in online learning","Juli Zhang and Ruoheng Xia and Qiguang Miao and Quan Wang","Expert Systems with Applications","2024","ScienceDirect","124933","257","Knowledge Tracing is a crucial aspect of personalized learning that aims to track the evolving knowledge states of students with respect to one or more concepts. However, existing literature either models knowledge state for each predefined concept separately, potentially overlooking the underlying interrelationships between concepts, or lacks the capability to uncover long-term dependencies within a historical sequence of questions. Furthermore, they have limitations in precisely identifying the mastery level of individual learners for specific concepts. In order to address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based knowledge tracing model, named Bayesian Cognitive-aware Key–Value Memory Network (BCKVMN). BCKVMN combines the strengths of Dynamic Key–Value Memory Network (DKVMN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), embedding layer, and Bayesian theory. To capture long-term dependencies in question sequences and contextual information, we extend DKVMN by incorporating a standard LSTM module that integrates cognitive processes observed in human learning. Additionally, we employ an embedding layer to uncover the influence of question difficulty on final predictions. Furthermore, we introduce Bayesian theory to enhance parameter interpretation for the model. To investigate complex representation of human learning, our approach considers not only three distinct learning states during the learning process but also the relationships between underlying concepts and students’ mastery levels for each concept. Experimental evaluations are conducted on the three real-world datasets Algebra200, ASSISTMENTS2009 and ASSISTMENTS2017. The results have demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods (achieving nearly 7% improvement in AUC in some cases) while achieving a better balance between performance and interpretability.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.124933","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424018001","","","Knowledge tracing, Deep learning, Bayesian, Personalized learning","","0957-4174","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"Towards more accurate and interpretable model: Fusing multiple knowledge relations into deep knowledge tracing","Zhiyi Duan and Xiaoxiao Dong and Hengnian Gu and Xiong Wu and Zhen Li and Dongdai Zhou","Expert Systems with Applications","2024","ScienceDirect","122573","243","With the rapid growth of online education, Knowledge tracing (KT) has become a well established problem, which evaluates the knowledge states of students and predicts their performance on new exercises. Recently, more and more works have noticed the importance of relations among knowledge points and proposed to introduce the knowledge relations into KT. However, how to precisely learn the representation of different types of knowledge relations and effectively fuse multiple relations into KT is still challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel KT model, called Deep Knowledge Tracing with Multiple Relations (DKTMR), which can simultaneously fuse the directed relation and undirected relation into KT. More specifically, casting the knowledge relations as a graph, DKTMR designs to utilize two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the representation of knowledge point with different relations via graph representation learning. Then, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to update the students’ knowledge states. Furthermore, to consider the different contribution for each type of relation to the final prediction, an attention-based fusion method is proposed to learn the coefficients for different relations. Compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, the extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of DKTMR.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122573","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423030750","","","Knowledge tracing, Knowledge relations, Graph representation learning, Attention-based fusion","","0957-4174","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

This journey involves employing various strategies to engage with and analyze innovative concepts. Adaptive hybrid learning systems adjust course materials dynamically based on individual students' skills and learning progress, drawing from diverse learning theories and instructional interventions. Empowering students to drive positive social change is a central focus, with social entrepreneurs tackling global challenges such as poverty, unemployment, gender inequality, inadequate education, healthcare, and governance. While some students may find traditional classroom settings inconvenient and prefer the flexibility of hybrid learning, others weigh the risks and benefits of classroom instruction differently. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is utilized for empirical analysis, utilizing early-stage social entrepreneurship education as a performance measure and cultural probabilities as variables. The significance of college students' contributions through social enterprises is increasingly recognized, prompting the development of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to forecast and assess career growth trends. The DEA-CNN framework aims to enhance adaptive hybrid learning systems by evaluating social entrepreneurs' knowledge, skills, and competencies. Social entrepreneurship not only addresses environmental concerns but also enriches cultural diversity. Many college students prioritize practical action over mere ideation, particularly in entrepreneurship.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lmot.2024.102023","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023969024000651","","","Social entrepreneurship, Data envelopment analysis, Convolutional Neural Network, Adaptive hybrid learning system, Learning theories","","0023-9690","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"

Data were collected from 8000 learners enrolled in the KMUTT015 course on the Thai MOOC platform. The k-means clustering algorithm classified learners enrolled in the Thai MOOC platform based on their online learning behaviors. The decision tree algorithm was used to assess the accuracy of the AI model prediction capability. The study finds the predictive AI model successfully categorizes learners based on their learning behaviors and predicts their future online learning behaviors in the online learning environment. The k-means clustering algorithm yields three groups of learners in the Thai MOOC platform: High Active Participants (HAP), Medium Active Participants (MAP), and Lurking participants.

"HiTSKT: A hierarchical transformer model for session-aware knowledge tracing","Fucai Ke and Weiqing Wang and Weicong Tan and Lan Du and Yuan Jin and Yujin Huang and Hongzhi Yin","Knowledge-Based Systems","2024","ScienceDirect","111300","284","Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to leverage students’ learning histories to estimate their mastery levels on a set of pre-defined skills, based on which the corresponding future performance can be accurately predicted. In practice, a student’s learning history comprises answers to sets of massed questions, each known as a session, rather than merely being a sequence of independent answers. Theoretically, within and across these sessions, students’ learning dynamics can be very different. Therefore, how to effectively model the dynamics of students’ knowledge states within and across the sessions is crucial for handling the KT problem. Most existing KT models treat student’s learning records as a single continuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students’ knowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to capture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a session(-level) encoder to summarize acquired knowledge across the past sessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a knowledge retriever integrates the summarized past-session knowledge with the previous interactions’ information into proper knowledge representations. These representations are then used to compute the student’s current knowledge state. Additionally, to model the student’s long-term forgetting behaviour across the sessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the session encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with seven state-of-the-art KT models.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2023.111300","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705123010481","","","User behaviour modelling, Knowledge tracing, Educational data mining, Learner modelling, Hierarchical transformer","","0950-7051","","","45805.948553241","45805.948553241","Rejected"
"A teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm with reinforcement learning to address wind farm layout optimization problem","Xiaobing Yu and Wen Zhang","Applied Soft Computing","2024","ScienceDirect","111135","151","As the global demand for renewable energy continues to rise, wind energy has received widespread attention as an eco-friendly energy source. Wind power generation is regarded as one of the key means to reduce carbon emissions and achieve sustainable development. Usually, a mass of turbines works together to produce electricity in a wind farm. However, downstream turbines will inevitably be influenced by the wake generated by upstream turbines, resulting in unused wind energy being lost. To reduce the negative effects of the wake, maximization of wind farm output power, and minimization of wind farm cost, a teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm with reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. The improvements of the proposed algorithm mainly include the following three points: i) the original serial structure of the algorithm is changed to a parallel structure to accelerate the convergence and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. ii) the parameter F, which is adjusted by RL, is proposed to adjust the selection of the updating phase due to the design of a parallel structure. iii) in the modified learner phase, an individual is added to participate in the update, and a selection probability is proposed to improve the ability of the algorithm to retain the information of superior individuals. To study the performance of the modified algorithm, it was first tested against 10 other advanced algorithms on a benchmark testing suite. They then ran numerical experiments on four hypothetical wind farm cases under two simulated wind conditions. Finally, the superiority of improved algorithm over others and the effectiveness of addressing wind farm layout problem are demonstrated by experimental results.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.111135","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494623011535","","","Teaching-learning-based optimization, Reinforcement learning, Wind farm layout optimization, Q-Learning algorithm, Meta-heuristic algorithm","","1568-4946","","","45805.948541667","45805.948553241","Rejected"

"Doubly constrained offline reinforcement learning for learning path recommendation","Yue Yun and Huan Dai and Rui An and Yupei Zhang and Xuequn Shang","Knowledge-Based Systems","2024","ScienceDirect","111242","284","Learning path recommendation refers to the application of interactive recommendation systems in the field of education, aimed at optimizing learning outcomes while minimizing the workload of learners, teachers, and curriculum designers. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven effective in capturing and modeling the complex interactions among course activities, learner behaviors, and educational outcomes. Therefore, combining the two approaches presents endless possibilities for personalized education through the use of interactive recommendation systems in the education domain. However, traditional RL algorithms require extensive interaction with the environment during the training phase. Using unverified recommendation logic in interactions with actual students can give rise to unmanageable problems and hinder effective performance in an educational setting. This is because extrapolation introduces substantial evaluation errors that result in recommendations deviating significantly from the actual educational requirements. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method of offline reinforcement learning called Doubly Constrained deep Q-learning Network (DCQN). This method utilizes two generative models to fit existing student historical interaction data, which in turn, constrains the original policy network to generate new actions based on past interactions, avoiding the occurrence of overestimated actions and reducing extrapolation errors. Empirical results on demonstrate that this approach performs better than existing techniques across D4RL, i.e., datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning and real educational datasets.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2023.111242","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705123009917","","","Learning path recommendation, Reinforcement learning, Offline reinforcement learning, Extrapolation errors, Recommendation systems","","0950-7051","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

However, existing mainstream KT models explore the importance of knowledge relations but ignore the key role of cognitive factors. According to the knowledge construction theory, the human cognitive system performs both spatial accommodation and temporal assimilation to internalize knowledge. In this paper, we propose an innovative heterogeneous graph-based Knowledge tracing method with spatiotemporal evolution (TSKT), in which knowledge state evolution is traced along both temporal and spatial dimensions. We construct a heterogeneous graph with multiple exercise attributes, including content, concepts, and difficulty, to obtain a knowledge space with richer exercise representations through hierarchical aggregation. We design a spatial updating module in which each interaction updates the current node’s state of the knowledge space and transfers its influence to its neighbors. We also design a temporal updating module to further update the knowledge state through short-term memory enhancing and long-term memory forgetting. Finally, we stack these modules to obtain deeper features by using alternate spatiotemporal updating. Extensive experiments on three datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed method and its variants in terms of future performance prediction.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122249","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423027513","","","Knowledge tracing, Heterogeneous graph, Knowledge construction, Spatiotemporal evolution","","0957-4174","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

In this chapter, we consider a broad cross-section of learning technologies and the social and ethical implications of adopting these technologies in higher education. Following a review of values in value-based approaches to psychometrics, we consider how specific formal and informal learning technologies manifest in various learning environments inside and outside of higher education, and the ethical affordances of these systems. We then expand on how these ethical affordances should impact our assessments of technology trustworthiness as well as the need for applications of current trust frameworks to expand their level of analysis beyond traditional evaluations of technology performance (e.g., accuracy and reliability), toward more sociotechnical system level considerations (e.g., social and organizational impacts).","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-15988-6.00003-0","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443159886000030","","","Education technology, Learning engineering, Sociotechnical systems, Trust","Academic Press","","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

Particularly, KT-Deeper initially employs temporal heterogeneous graphs to model the interconnections between different types of knowledge entities (e.g., students, exercises, and skills). Subsequently, KT-Deeper formalizes knowledge tracing as a dynamic link prediction task on the temporal heterogeneous graph sequence and proposes a reinforced graph generation approach to refine the incomplete graph sequence for supporting long-term knowledge tracing. KT-Deeper further presents a self-supervised heterogeneous graph embedding method to extract the structural features of knowledge evolution. Finally, KT-Deeper leverages recurrent neural networks to learn the temporal features of students’ cognitive evolution and predict whether a student will master a specific skill. Experimental results confirm that KT-Deeper exhibits superior performance compared to existing cutting-edge techniques, showcasing its promising accuracy and robustness in incomplete long-term knowledge tracing tasks.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112194","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624009682","","","Cognitive evolution, Knowledge tracing, Reinforcement learning, Temporal heterogeneous graph","","1568-4946","","","45805.948541667","45805.948541667","Rejected"

This research conducted two experimental studies to investigate what and how multimodal data can be used to measure and classify learners' real-time cognitive load. The results found that it was a promising method to predict learners' cognitive load by analysing their handwriting, touch gestural and eye-tracking data individually and conjunctively. The machine learning approach used in this research achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.86 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 0.85/0.86 sensitivity/specificity by only using handwriting data, 0.93 AUC and 0.93/0.94 sensitivity/specificity by only using touch gestural data, and 0.94 AUC and 0.94/0.95 sensitivity/specificity by using both the touch gestural and eye-tracking data. The results can contribute to the optimization of cognitive load and the development of adaptive learning systems for pen-based mobile learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Pen-based mobile learning systems allow natural ways of handwriting and gestural touching, which can facilitate learners' cognitive processes in mobile learning. Behavioural and physiological multimodal data are helpful in detecting learners' real-time cognitive load in mobile learning. The effectiveness of behavioural and physiological multimodal data for measuring cognitive load in pen-based mobile learning is limited investigated. What this paper adds This paper confirms the effectiveness of handwriting and touch gestural multimodal data for measuring pen-based learning cognitive load, in terms of their stroke-, path- and time-based features. This paper explores the potential of eye-tracking data in measuring pen-based learning cognitive load. A combination of behavioural and physiological multimodal data is reported to increase the prediction accuracy for cognitive load measurement.

"Enhancing Online Learning Experiences: A Systematic Review on Integrating GenAI Chatbots into the Community of Inquiry Framework","Olivier, Corna and Weilbach, Lizette","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","2024","Engineering Village","77 - 89","14907 LNCS","<div data-language=""eng"" data-ev-field=""abstract"">The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework has been used for nearly two decades to provide educators with a way to design and evaluate their online courses. Integrating generative AI (GenAI) chatbots with the CoI framework will address the current lack of clear guidelines for incorporating GenAI technology in online education. This gap is significant as GenAI in education is rapidly growing, with students showing favorable attitudes towards GenAI integration. To explore this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, analyzing recent studies on the use of GenAI chatbots as intelligent tutoring systems within the CoI framework. The findings revealed that GenAI chatbots enhance cognitive presence through personalized learning paths and real-time feedback, improve social presence by fostering community and continuous support, and strengthen teaching presence by automating administrative tasks and dynamic instructional strategies. These enhancements suggest that integrating GenAI chatbots can significantly enrich online learning environments, making education more dynamic, personalized, and effective. The study concludes that a seamless integration of GenAI technologies within the CoI framework can optimize digital learning ecosystems, and future research should focus on long-term impacts and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible GenAI use in education.<br/></div> © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2024.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72234-9_7","","","Adversarial machine learning;Federated learning;Generative adversarial networks;","","03029743","English","AI tutor;Chatbots;Cognitive presence;Community of inquiry;Community of inquiry framework;Generative artificial intelligence chatbot;Online learning;Social presence;Systematic Review;Teaching presence;","45631.610497685","45631.610497685","Rejected"

However, for many schoolchildren, learning arithmetic can be a difficult and often tedious task. Traditional methods of teaching arithmetic, such as rote memorization and repetitive practice, may not always be effective in engaging pupils and promoting a deep understanding of the material. To address these challenges, educators have explored alternative methods of teaching arithmetic that can engage pupils and promote a deeper understanding of the subject. A promising approach is the use of digital games. The objective of this research paper is to create a digital game in the form of a ""Game & learn"" web application that can be used to teach arithmetic to primary school children, the application is accessible via a web browser and includes a user-friendly interface suitable for children aged 6 to 11.

For instance, many online ITSs are accessible to students 24/7, have multi-modality (desktop, mobile, virtual reality systems), and provide consistent curricula across students, classes, and schools. A growing design consideration of ITSs is the customization of the student experience. Modern systems tailor the curriculum to each student’s performance by providing remediation when students perform poorly or accelerating a student through lessons when strong proficiency is demonstrated. A challenge to these systems is that this customization is traditionally reactionary and only adjusts the student’s learning plan after the student has performed sub-optimally or overachieved. Proactive interventions often rely on a shared and generalized predictive algorithm that is trained on a collection of students’ past performances but applied to individual students. The presented work investigates the inconsistencies of these generalized predictive models to demonstrate that one algorithm does not work best for all students. This work sets the groundwork for the human digital twin, which models the individual student progression through an ITS and customizes the student performance predictive capabilities.<br/></div> © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62277-9_19","","","Computer aided instruction;Curricula;E-learning;Education computing;Learning systems;Machine learning;Online systems;Students;Virtual reality;","","23673370","English","Customisation;Intelligent tutoring;Learning analytic;Machine-learning;On-line education;Performance;Performance prediction models;Student performance;Systems education;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

In the learner model, acknowledging the affective aspects of learning is important for a range of learner outcomes, including motivation, persistence, and engagement. Learners’ affective states can be detected using physical (e.g. cameras) and physiological sensors (e.g., EEG) in online learning. Although these detectors demonstrate high accuracy, they raise privacy concerns for learners and present challenges in deploying them on a large scale to larger groups of students or in classroom settings. Consequently, researchers have designed an alternative method that can recognise students’ affective states at any point during online learning from their interaction with a computer-based learning platform (i.e. intelligent tutoring systems) without using any sensors. Existing sensor-free affect detectors however, are less accurate and not directly generalisable to other domains and systems. This research focuses on developing generalisable sensor-free affect detectors to identify students’ frustration during online learning using machine learning classifiers. The detectors were built by identifying minimal optimal features associated with frustration from the high-dimensional feature space through a series of experiments on a real-world students’ affective dataset, which are generalisable across various learning platforms and domains. To evaluate their accuracy and generalisability, the detectors’ performance was validated on two independent datasets collected from different educational institutions. The experimental results show that cost-sensitive Bayesian classifiers can achieve higher affect detection accuracies with a small number of generalisable features compared to other classifiers.<br/></div> © The Author(s) 2024.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-024-09402-4","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Feature extraction;Online systems;Space platforms;","","09241868","English","Affect detection;Frustration;Frustration detection;Intelligent tutoring;Intelligent tutoring system;Machine-learning;Online learning;Sensor-free affect detection;Tutoring system;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in recommendation systems, particularly within digital library contexts, this paper presents an innovative approach using Generative AI to define digital assistance in E-Learning environments. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, which suggest resources based on explicit patterns or user metadata, our Generative AI model dynamically crafts personalized content based on learners’ preferences and progress. We juxtapose our methods with prevalent deep learning-based recommendation systems as discussed in prior research. The novelty of our approach lies in the amalgamation of generative algorithms with personalized recommendation, thereby offering a dynamic, real-time, and context-aware learning guide. The paper elaborates on the model’s architecture, its performance metrics in comparison to existing methods, and its implications for the future of digital education.

These classes quantify the students’ level of cognitive engagement in their online course discussion posts. We used textual attributes and label-specific characteristics (e.g., text length, sentiment polarity, and subjectivity) to gain comprehensive insights into the forum posts’ emotional and cognitive depth. We further refined these features with a pre-trained GloVe embedding, which enhanced the classification accuracy. We interpreted the model’s decision-making process using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for added transparency and interpretability.

This advantage enables researchers to assess learners’ mastery through their learning trajectories, thereby facilitating personalized education and support. Knowledge tracing, an effective educational aid, simulates students’ implicit knowledge states and predicts their mastery over knowledge based on their historical answer records. However, for newly developed online learning platforms, the lack of sufficient historical answer data may impede accurate prediction of students’ knowledge states, rendering existing knowledge tracing models less effective. This paper introduces the first pre-trained knowledge tracing model that leverages a substantial amount of existing data for pre-training and a smaller dataset for fine-tuning. Validated across several publicly available knowledge tracing datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvement in tracing performance on small datasets, with a maximum AUC increase of 5.07%. Beyond incorporating small datasets, our approach of pre-training the entire dataset has shown an enhanced AUC compared to the baseline, marking a novel direction in knowledge tracing research. Furthermore, the paper analyzed the outcomes of pre-training experiments with varying numbers of interactions as fine-tuning datasets, providing valuable insights for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS).<br/></div> © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-68309-1_14","","","Adversarial machine learning;Federated learning;","","03029743","English","Education systems;Fine tuning;Knowledge state;Knowledge tracings;Learning data;Limited data;On-line education;Pre-training;Small data set;Tracing model;","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

In particular, the new curriculum emphasizes developing skills necessary for modern-day life. Peer-led interactive group learning is an effective method of teaching those desired skills. One such technology embracing these methods of learning is the ""Magical Leaders"" programme. However, creating an environment that allows for optimum delivery of the content is difficult as the teacher needs to deal with the new method of content delivery as well as any behavioral or social issues that exist in the classroom. We investigate three factors that affect the successful delivery of the ""Magical Leaders"" programme: group composition; peer leader selection; and preparation time. We find that classes in which the teacher selects the groups complete the challenges more than 10 min quicker than those classes in which the peers select the groups or they are randomly assigned. The mean time to complete each challenge was approximately the same for groups in which the peer leaders were selected by the teacher and those groups were volunteers. However, the number of volunteer-led groups that finished on or before schedule was higher. Groups with peer leaders who completed less than 30 min of preparation time finished on average 9 min quicker than groups with peer leaders who did more than 30 min of preparation time. However, while the mean time is much less the number of classes finishing on time is higher for those with more preparation time, 60%, than those will 30 min of less preparation time, 52%.<br/></div> © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63028-6_33","","","Computer aided instruction;E-learning;Learning systems;Teaching;","","03029743","English","Education technology;Ireland;Learning environments;Optimisations;Pedagogical approach;Peer lead learning;Peer leaders;Primary schools;School education;Teachers';","45631.610486111","45631.610486111","Rejected"

To address these concerns, we developed Kid Space to enable pedagogically appropriate technology use for children in early childhood education by combining various sensing technologies with a multi-modal conversational artificial intelligence system that can interact with children, understand individual progress and provide personalised learning experiences. To understand the impact of Kid Space on the parents' initial concerns about technology use by their young children, we conducted a multi-method user study: (1) a quasi-experimental design and (2) formative research method using an exploratory case study with a set of children and their parents experiencing Kid Space in their homes. The results show that after experiencing Kid Space with their children, the parents felt significantly less concerned about screen time, social interactions and physical activity and reported positive perceptions towards pedagogical value of Kid Space. Detailed analysis on the multi-modal data quantitatively and qualitatively validated why Kid Space alleviated these concerns. Future research is needed to validate long-term educational value of Kid Space and generate insights for improvement for next iterations. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Play-based learning is critical for young children's education, but digital games create major concerns around extended screen time, lack of physical activity and lack of social interactions. Blending digital and physical spaces could support pedagogically appropriate technology use for young children. Towards this end, there are some exemplary studies in the state–of-the-art reporting positive educational outcomes as an effect of utilising such spaces. However, none of these studies supported children's most natural mode of communication in their interactions with the systems—speaking. Pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs) are promising, but they are tricky when it comes to young children's speech because of unique technical challenges resulted from how children use language and communicate with digital systems. What this paper adds To our best knowledge, Kid Space is one of the earliest implementations of a PCA with a multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) system utilising physical and digital learning manipulatives for maths learning with a focus on early childhood education. The key contributions of this paper are (1) the design and development of an end-to-end multi-modal system enabling Wizard-of-Oz experimentation for initial evaluations with users, (2) the creation of a multi-modal, in-the-wild labelled dataset with children–agent, children–parent and children–physical/digital space interactions enabling advancements for AI components for later evaluations with users and (3) the generation of rich insights from an initial research study on user perceptions and engagement as well as actionable findings to improve Kid Space experiences for next iterations and inform key design features for similar systems. Implications for practice and/or policy The results of the study implied a set of areas for improvement—or design features—for Kid Space and other similar pedagogical conversational systems developed for children's home usages: (1) easier setup and usage with optimised setup size addressing diverse space limitations at homes, (2) minimised latency between Oscar (the conversational pedagogical agent) and child interactions (eg, adding multimodal dialogue system to reduce the need for a human wizard), (3) more advanced personalisation, social (including more verbal interactions) and pedagogical skills for Oscar with increased contextual awareness (eg, sending children's engagement), (4) scalability and higher visual quality of conten","Article","10.1111/bjet.13399","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174303708&doi=10.1111%2fbjet.13399&partnerID=40&md5=5d03efef3c313a585867759a40b5e485","","","","","","","Cited by: 2","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"

However, the availability of quantitative models for personalized playback speed control considering the learner's personal traits is still an open question. The work aims to develop a model to control the personalized playback speed of audio information for beginners and experienced learners for intelligent tutoring systems. Analysis of the data from the experimental study using traditional machine learning methods did not allow us to classify the preferred playback rate with accuracy higher than 60%. Therefore, we developed the three-level hierarchical logistic model that predicts the preferred playback speed of audio material on the scale from 'very low speed' to 'high speed' for beginners and experienced learners with 80% accuracy. The model uses a combination of cognitive and psychomotor traits of individual learners and aims to maximize audio listening convenience and satisfaction. We explained the influence of the learners' selected personal traits on the preferred speed of audio playback. We calculated the convenience of listening to the audio materials without and with the model. By using the model, the convenience of listening to audio materials increased by an average of 13% at a low speech speed and 37% at a high speech speed. The model extends the control theory of multimedia information in e-learning systems by describing the influence of selected psychophysiological traits of learners on the preferred playback speed of audio materials.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Article","10.1109/TLT.2024.3439470","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200806829&doi=10.1109%2fTLT.2024.3439470&partnerID=40&md5=4ed37aa2c9a6746705875549b0112c4d","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"

As a strategy for improving educational technologies, gamification can enhance learning effectiveness by engaging students in enjoyable learning tasks. However, existing literature emphasizes the importance of tailoring gamification elements, considering factors such as the student’s gender. Neglecting such factors may lead to adverse effects stemming from stereotypes and diminishing the learning experience. Thus, we conducted a 2×3 factorial experimental study with 122 students focusing on a gamified intelligent tutoring system for teaching logic in Brazilian higher education. Our findings revealed that gender stereotypes significantly motivated men to reject and counteract these stereotypes when perceived as a threat. In a gamified intelligent tutoring system with female stereotypes, males were motivated to alter their positions in the rankings, underscoring the impact of stereotype threat on their perception of relevance. Our results also evidenced that gamification did not impact the flow state of students and, across all scenarios, the learning performance of males consistently exceeded that of females. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Conference paper","10.1007/978-3-031-64312-5_11","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199767964&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-64312-5_11&partnerID=40&md5=b203633ad2316836c8ab15622f278150","","","","","","","Cited by: 0","45630.959386574","45630.959386574","Rejected"
"Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares: What We Must Do","Baecker, Ronald M. and Grudin, Jonathan","","2024","ACM Digital Library","","56","This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past.

However, evaluating socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) proves challenging due to the dynamic and infrequent cognitive and socio-emotional interactions, which constitute the focal point of SSRL. To address this challenge, this article gathers interdisciplinary researchers to establish a multimodal dataset with cognitive and socio-emotional interactions for SSRL study. Firstly, to induce cognitive and socio-emotional interactions, learning science researchers designed a special collaborative learning task with regulatory trigger events among triadic people for the SSRL study. Secondly, this dataset includes various modalities like video, Kinect data, audio, and physiological data (accelerometer, EDA, heart rate) from 81 high school students in 28 groups, offering a comprehensive view of the SSRL process. Thirdly, three-level verbal interaction annotations and nonverbal interactions including facial expression, eye gaze, gesture, and posture are provided, which could further contribute to interdisciplinary fields such as computer science, sociology, and education. In addition, comprehensive analysis verifies the dataset’s effectiveness. As far as we know, this is the first multimodal dataset for studying SSRL among triadic group members.","","10.1145/3658376","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3658376","","","Multimodal dataset, human interaction, facial expression, gesture, physiological signal, collaborative learning","Association for Computing Machinery","2160-6455","","","45630.956400463","45630.956400463","Rejected"

With growing complexity and countless interactions in modern games, capturing how damage unfolds becomes an intricate problem - for developers just as for players. Misunderstanding how to optimize damage potentials includes risks of game imbalances, game-breaking exploits, mismatches between player skill and challenge (harming flow), and impaired perceived competence. All of these considerably impact player experience, game reception, success, and retention, yet polishing optimal strategies remains often a player community effort. To accelerate, inform and ease this process, we implemented an interactive tool capable of simulating, visualizing, planning and comparing damage strategies in video games.

The system is designed to provide a convenient online self-learning environment for surgical medical workers to test themselves and learn at different times. Synchronized multi-user online operation is a core function of the quiz system, which allows users to identify and diagnose surgical instruments. The system can also test the learners' familiarity with various types of surgical instruments through a quiz game. During the test, users can know their personal ranking after the quiz, and determine the areas in which they need to strengthen learning. The quiz system provides a flexible learning pathway for medical workers on 24-hour shifts in the operating room, and promotes the concepts of independent learning and continuous education through interactive media and game-based learning mechanisms that make the learning process more interesting. The application of the quiz system facilitates medical workers’ mastery of selected surgical instruments, and provides a cogent example of innovation in education and training. In order to verify the effectiveness of the system, 58 medical workers participated in the quiz, and their questionnaire feedback reflected their satisfaction and the impact of the learning environment. The results also indicate that the quiz system has the potential to be applied to many other aspects in industrial circles, and can provide a wide range of management and practice benefits.

"Question Difficulty Consistent Knowledge Tracing","Liu, Guimei and Zhan, Huijing and Kim, Jung-jae","","2024","ACM Digital Library","4239–4248","","Knowledge tracing aims to estimate knowledge states of students over a set of skills based on students' past learning activities. Deep learning based knowledge tracing models show superior performance to traditional knowledge tracing approaches. Early works like DKT use skill IDs and student responses only. Recent works also incorporate questions IDs into their models and achieve much improved performance in the next question correctness prediction task. However, predictions made by these models are thus on specific questions, and it is not straightforward to translate them to estimation of students' knowledge states over skills. In this paper, we propose to replace question IDs with question difficulty levels in deep knowledge tracing models. The predictions made by our model can be more readily translated to students' knowledge states over skills. Furthermore, by using question difficulty levels to replace question IDs, we can also alleviate the cold-start problem in knowledge tracing as online learning platforms are updated frequently with new questions. We further use two techniques to smooth the predicted scores. One is to combine embeddings of nearby difficulty levels using the Hann function. The other is to constrain the predicted probabilities to be consistent with question difficulties by imposing a penalty if they are not consistent. We conduct extensive experiments to study the performance of the proposed model. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art knowledge tracing models in terms of both accuracy and consistency with question difficulty levels.","","10.1145/3589334.3645582","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3589334.3645582","","","cold-start questions, deep knowledge tracing, question difficulty","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.956342593","45630.956342593","Rejected"

"A Question-centric Multi-experts Contrastive Learning Framework for Improving the Accuracy and Interpretability of Deep Sequential Knowledge Tracing Models","Zhang, Hengyuan and Liu, Zitao and Shang, Chenming and Li, Dawei and Jiang, Yong","ACM Trans. Knowl. Discov. Data","2024","ACM Digital Library","","","Knowledge tracing (KT) plays a crucial role in predicting students’ future performance by analyzing their historical learning processes. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown great potential in solving the KT problem. However, there still exist some important challenges when applying deep learning techniques to model the KT process. The first challenge lies in modeling the individual question information. This is crucial because students’ knowledge acquisition on questions that share the same set of knowledge components (KCs) may vary significantly. However, due to the large question bank, the average number of interactions per question may not be sufficient. This limitation can potentially result in overfitting of the question embedding and inaccurate question knowledge acquisition state that relies on its corresponding question representation. Furthermore, there is a considerable portion of questions receiving relatively less interaction from students in comparison to the majority of questions. This can further increase the risk of overfitting and lower the accuracy of the obtained question knowledge acquisition state. The second challenge lies in interpreting the prediction results from existing deep learning-based KT models. In real-world applications, while it may not be necessary to have complete transparency and interpretability of the model parameters, it is crucial to present the model’s prediction results in a manner that teachers find interpretable. This makes teachers accept the rationale behind the prediction results and utilize them to design teaching activities and tailored learning strategies for students. However, the inherent black-box nature of deep learning techniques often poses a hurdle for teachers to fully embrace the model’s prediction results. To address these challenges, we propose a Question-centric Multi-experts Contrastive Learning framework for KT called Q-MCKT. This framework explicitly models students’ knowledge acquisition state at both the question and concept levels. It leverages the mixture of experts technique to capture a more robust and accurate knowledge acquisition state in both question and concept levels for prediction. Additionally, a fine-grained question-centric contrastive learning task is introduced to enhance the representations of less interactive questions and improve the accuracy of their corresponding question knowledge acquisition states. Moreover, Q-MCKT utilizes an item response theory-based prediction layer to generate interpretable prediction results based on the knowledge acquisition states obtained from the question and concept knowledge acquisition modules. We evaluate the proposed Q-MCKT framework on four public real-world educational datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide range of deep learning-based KT models in terms of prediction accuracy while maintaining better model interpretability.

Different from the existing research which utilizes fixed-length learning sequence to obtain the student states and regards KT as a static problem, this work is motivated by three dynamical characteristics: 1) The scales of students answering records are constantly growing; 2) The semantics of time intervals between the records vary; 3) The relationships between students, questions and concepts are evolving. The three dynamical characteristics above contain the great potential to revolutionize the existing knowledge tracing methods. Along this line, we propose a Dynamic Graph-based Knowledge Tracing model, namely DyGKT. In particular, a continuous-time dynamic question-answering graph for knowledge tracing is constructed to deal with the infinitely growing answering behaviors, and it is worth mentioning that it is the first time dynamic graph learning technology is used in this field. Then, a dual time encoder is proposed to capture long-term and short-term semantics among the different time intervals. Finally, a multiset indicator is utilized to model the evolving relationships between students, questions, and concepts via the graph structural feature. Numerous experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model.

However, generating and linking KCs to assessment items requires significant effort and domain-specific knowledge. To streamline this process for higher-education courses, we employed GPT-4 to generate KCs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Chemistry and E-Learning. We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts. We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy accurately matched KCs for 56\% of Chemistry and 35\% of E-Learning MCQs, with even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically significant across both domains. Our clustering algorithm successfully grouped questions by their underlying KCs without needing explicit labels or contextual information.

Knowl. Discov. Data","2024","ACM Digital Library","","","Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict students’ future performance on answering questions based on their historical exercise sequences. To alleviate the problem of data sparsity in KT, recent works have introduced auxiliary information to mine question similarity, resulting in the enhancement of question embeddings. Nonetheless, there remains a gap in developing an approach that effectively incorporates various forms of auxiliary information, including relational information (e.g., question-student, question-skill relation), relationship attributes (e.g., correctness indicating a student's performance on a question), and node attributes (e.g., student ability). To tackle this challenge, the Similarity-enhanced Question Embedding (SimQE) method for KT is proposed, with its central feature being the utilization of weighted and attributed meta-paths for extracting question similarity. To capture multi-dimensional question similarity semantics by integrating multiple relations, various meta-paths are constructed for learning question embeddings separately. These embeddings, each encoding different similarity semantics, are then fused to serve the task of KT. To capture finer-grained similarity by leveraging the relationship attributes and node attributes on the meta-paths, the biased random walk algorithm is designed. In addition, the auxiliary node generation method is proposed to capture high-order question similarity. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on 6 datasets demonstrate that SimQE performs the best among 10 representative question embedding methods. Furthermore, SimQE proves to be more effective in alleviating the problem of data sparsity.","","10.1145/3703158","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3703158","","","Knowledge Tracing, Question Embedding, Similarity Mining, Weighted Heterogeneous Information Network","Association for Computing Machinery","1556-4681","","Just Accepted","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"

Existing KT models have two limitations. One is that these models do not fully utilize the associative structure between knowledge concepts. Knowledge concepts are not isolated but are interrelated and have an important influence on each other, making their correlations a critical piece of information. The other limitation is that many KT models do not pay sufficient attention to individual differences among students in the learning process. Different students have different learning abilities, whose impact on students’ knowledge state should not be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a Concept Structure Key-Value Memory Network knowledge tracing model (CSKVMN) that considers the associative structure of knowledge concepts and students’ learning abilities.

However, the most common metrics (i.e., those focused on individual- or group-conditioned error rates) are not currently well-suited to educational settings because they assume that each individual observation is independent from the others. This is not statistically appropriate when studying certain common educational outcomes, because such metrics cannot account for the relationship between students in classrooms or multiple observations per student across an academic year. In this paper, we present novel adaptations of algorithmic bias measurements for regression for both independent and nested data structures. Using hierarchical linear models, we rigorously measure algorithmic bias in a machine learning model of the relationship between student engagement in an intelligent tutoring system and year-end standardized test scores. We conclude that classroom-level influences had a small but significant effect on models. Examining significance with hierarchical linear models helps determine which inequalities in educational settings might be explained by small sample sizes rather than systematic differences.","","10.1145/3636555.3636869","https://doi-org.ez39.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1145/3636555.3636869","","","Algorithmic bias, Intelligent tutoring systems, Interactive learning environments, Predictive analytics","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","45630.95619213","45630.95619213","Rejected"

To this end, we combine Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and transformer sentence encoders (SBERT) to construct a transparent learner model. Specifically, we explicitly involve learners in modeling their knowledge state by enabling them to mark concepts as ’Did Not Understand’ (DNU) in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. This results in the construction of a user-controllable and scrutable PKG for the learner, thus increasing the transparency of the learner modeling process. Furthermore, we leverage GCNs and SBERT to model the learner knowledge state based on an enhanced representation of their DNUs.
